## What are the summary documents?

This folder contains summaries and quotations from three focus group sessions held with autistic people, the relatives and carers of autistic people, researchers and developers, about the Autistica/Turing citizen science project.

The sessions were held with members of Autistica's Insight group, Fujitsu, The Turing, and Autistica on the 18th and 24th September 2019, and 4th October 2019. You can read the detailed summaries by following the links above.

We want to share the insights from our conversations to help others understand how they can best support the needs of autistic people with sensory processing differences.

The summary document is a collection of anonymised quotes from focus group participants.

Quotations have been shortened or summarised, labelled according to the speaker (see the [Key] in the README file), and all information has been depersonalised.

These summaries have been circulated to all participants to offer them the opportunity to remove or modify their comments if they wish.
Based on the feedback receieved, none of the content was requested to be changed, but the format was modified.

## How were the summary documents created?

### 1. Design focus group agenda: 

An agenda for each session was written to loosely guide the focus group discussions. 
The agendas used in the sessions can be found [here - link].
These were based on researcher knowledge of what was important to investigate and determine from a developer and researcher prespective, as well as from the input of [no.] autistic poeple, their relatives and carers, in earlier, informal scoping sessions. 
The request for potential questions was also sent out to subscribers of the project's mailing list, and autistic collaborators input suggestions [link to newsletter and OS comments]


### 2. Run focus group <img src="../../images/noun-project-icons/noun_Conversation_2041500.png" width="150" align="right"/>

Participants came to a focus group at Fujitsu to talk about a project to design a platform to use for autism research.

In line with Autistica's policy, all sessions were held outside of rush hour. 
Refreshments including vegan and gluten free options were provided after the request of some participants, and a quiet room was available.
There were always multiple facilitators present.
All participants were talked through the agenda and a consent form [link to consent form]

All participants from Autistica's Insight Group were paid in line with Autistica's policy and involve guidelines [link to their website].

The focus group was recorded.

### 2. Transcribe discussion <img src="../../images/noun-project-icons/noun_transcript_532343.png" width="150" align="right"/>

The focus group was written down word-for-word. No personally identifying information was included in this document.

Personally identifying information includes:

* Names of individuals
* Precise ages
* Schools, workplaces, universities, and addresses

The recordings were then deleted.

### 3. Collect anonymised quotes <img src="../../images/noun-project-icons/noun_Document_188540.png" width="150" align="right"/>

Quotations were taken from the document, shortened, and organised into groups based on common themes.

The quotations were labelled to show whether the speaker is autistic, or the parent or carer of someone autistic, if they are one of the project's researchers, and which organisation they come from. 
The quotes are also labelled to show whether the speaker is talking directly about their own experience, indirectly about someone else's experience, or generally about a group's experience.
This labelling system was co-designed by a researcher and an autistic collaborator. 

The resulting, organised and labelleed insights were sent to participants. 

### 4. Review the summary document <img src="../../images/noun-project-icons/noun_Eye_2040041.png" width="150" align="right"/>

All participants had a chance to [review the summary document](Reviewing the summary document) and make changes.
They were given 14 days to do this. All participants from Autistica's Insight group were paid [amount] for their extra time. 

We asked them to:

1. Understand the purpose of the document and what is going to happen with the insights.
2. Understand the information in the document.
3. Ensure the information is appropriately anonymised.
4. Send us any requested changes.

[link to review email]

There were no requested changes to the content of the documents, however there were some suggested improvements to the layout, formatting, and labelling of the documents. 
The document was subsequently changed on the basis of this feeback.

## How will the summary documents be used? 

### Publish insights online <img src="../../images/noun-project-icons/noun_online_1632606.png" width="150" align="right"/>

The summary documents are published online at: [https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience).

The quotes from the focus groups can be used by anyone and for any purpose.
Anyone using the information must credit the Autistica/Citizen Science community.

Potential users include:

* Future contributors to this project who want to add to the insights from the focus groups.
* Autism researchers and advocates who want to make sure they are serving the needs of autistic people.
* Parents, friends and colleagues who want to better understand how to support an autistic person they know.

### Write down platform requirements <img src="../../images/noun-project-icons/noun_todolist_1128326.png" width="150" align="right"/>

The suggestions from the focus group will be turned into a to-do list for the project team of researchers, developers, and designers, and for the wider community.

These will be visible as issues in GitHub, and will be linked to the source in the summary. 

The issues will be used to help build the citizen science platform. [example issue here]

We can't do everything, but we will try our best to follow the suggestions included in the summaries.
