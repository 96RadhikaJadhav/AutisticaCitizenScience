* The Wolf (its a childrens movie but fun to watch)
* Moana (inspired by my niece), or the YouTube channel The School of Life https://www.youtube.com/user/schooloflifechannel
* I love The Colour of Pomegranates - watched this for thee first time recently. It's very beautiful and also surreal.
* I got a Disney+ subscription so I'm watching all the Avengers movies in chronological order :sweat_smile: They're so fun!
* After Life

* Issues (user stories) and milestones (collections of issues):
  * https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/issues
  * https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/milestones
* Project --> Epic --> Feature --> Story --> Task
* Combination of Agile and Open Source working
  * https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/blob/master/project-management/agile-opensource-workflow.md
* Minimum viable product
  * High, medium and low categorisation
* Component development

#### Questions & comments

* Thanks for the wonderful work on the component-based coding, it looks really well documented. 

###  Overview of work part 2

***Overview of work part 2: Community Engagement Process (121 Feedback, Wireframe), and The Component Development Undertaken throughout Sprints 1 - 6***

* Presented by Chris
* Community feedback mechanisms
  * https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/blob/master/project-management/wireframes/feedback-mechanism.md
  * https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/blob/master/project-management/wireframes/community-questions.md
  * https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/blob/master/project-management/wireframes/design-decisions.md
  * ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/master/images/design-decisions/image16.png)
* Non-verbal input
  * https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/issues/200
  
* This is a great work Chris and really impressive all the research you've done! 
I think it would be useful to have a chat about how we showcase it on the repository?

### User testing & GitHub reorganisation

* Presented by Katharina
* Demonstration of new GitHub organisation from https://github.com/katoss/katoss.github.io
* User testing documentation:
  * How to guide: https://github.com/katoss/katoss.github.io/blob/master/project-management/engagement-guides/user-tests/how-to-prepare-a-1-to-1-online-user-testing-session.md
  * Detailed schedule: https://github.com/katoss/katoss.github.io/tree/master/community-recommendations/user-tests/sprint-6-feedback
* Feedback
  * Example participant: https://github.com/katoss/katoss.github.io/blob/master/community-recommendations/user-tests/sprint-6-feedback/user2-sprint6-feedback.md
* Next step: transform feedback into issues
* Organise specific conversations for different pages in the upcoming weeks

### Plans for going forward

* Presented by Craig
* 50 charities put themselves forward to be selected as Fujitsu's charity partner
  * Autistica voted to be extended!
  * This means we will have Fujitsu's time to work on the project extended. :tada: 
  
### Open Q & A

* skateboard/bicycle and car - how great it would be if it was a train at the end with different carriage - 
it would help different people - this might be a better metaphor for the process
found the computer speech grainy and some of the words weren't clear 
have a human voice that you can speed up and slow down - softer in tone
* because of Covid having lots of meltdown - on website have calming videos on how to calm down
could this be linked into websites e.g. dyslexia, adhd, other websites - link this in together -
use information to help - done research on other learning difficulties so may be easier to link in
hard to get people to volunteer - maybe ask autistic school/learning support if autistic children would like to take part
a younger generation might be able to/support workers - support workers
* next step would be to create a public narrative around the community engagement and co-design work that has been done and showing routes to getting involved.
follow up session to turn user stories into issues - anyone can join. 
* any forms of technology in the future - ideas to help people - ideas centres?
* [name=Kirstie] website having calming videos - best thing to do is to link out to resources that already exist, 
so rather than recreate our own, we have a space that recreates it - something to transfer you on to useful resource if you are mid-meltdown - 
could also do in terms of if it's difficult to engage with the project, things which have helped others liked you. 
Direct people to where they can find out more information.
in the focus group meetings, we discussed a lot around motivation, and part of that was discussio naround sharing information that may help autistic people, 
so we have already captured some of that requirement from the community that may help and assist autistic people - 
we are providing some levels of design from the wireframe perspective as well.
Temple Grandin may be a good film to watch 
There's another github repository which is where the code is living for the WIP - screenshots on component led development - 
haven't seen issues on project board that capture that - issues that we have on project board are quite designed focussed and project management focussed - 
but tend not to see many issues related to coding tasks.
Is there a solution of having two project boards? How are you thinking about and managing those tasks internally?
created design tasks for  the designer - wheere we're struggling at the moment is having those finalised designs reviewed by the community, 
so need some closure on a lot of the design tasks from a review perspective so can then open up development activities.
Good to have more a focus on closing off some of the design issues so then close off development tasks.
* [name=Kirstie] how does this align with agile development methodology of continuous and iterative feedback?
* looking into Open Humans and integrating in front end - at moment linked into static dataset.
We would then replace that with real data source when linked into Open Humans
		* [name=Kirstie] the integration work is what needs to be on the project board
    * a lot of work ready to review or ready for testing. Having a clean project board is important. 
    In terms of cycle. Design work - you can have one ticket which has different elements in it, which is then columns in the project board
 * I couldn't figure out how to link my PR to the issue because they're in separate repositories
 * [name=Kirstie] point to reflect on in relation to redesign by Katharina - folder on prototypes should have a really good README.
 Requires purposeful documentation
 * many autistic people are really artistic - they could draw their experiences
	* [name=Kirstie] it would be great to have people to illustrate what we're talking about. 
  There's a pic Georgia uses in talks which is a mind map - beautiful and accesible - should incorporate images so don't have huge blocks of text
