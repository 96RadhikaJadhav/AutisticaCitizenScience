# Google Form Survey Data

This folder contains the feedeback collected from the always open [Google Form survey](https://bit.ly/AutisticaTuringCitSciForm). 

All content submitted to the survey is moderated by the core research team to make sure the content is not personally identifying, and does not contravene the project's [code of conduct](https://github.com/katoss/katoss.github.io/blob/master/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

It is regularly updated. 

The survey data is available in two formats:

  * Human readable format: [pdf](Autistica_Turing%20Citizen%20Science%20Platform%20(Responses)%20-%20Form%20Responses%201(2).pdf)
  * Machine readable format: [csv](Autistica_Turing%20Citizen%20Science%20Platform%20(Responses)%20-%20Form%20Responses%201(2).csv)
