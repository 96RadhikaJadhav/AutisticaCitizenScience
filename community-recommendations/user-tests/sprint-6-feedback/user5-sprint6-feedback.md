# Prototype

### Landing Page ([https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=0-home-light-non-newsletter-lang-drop__1___1_&view=b](https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=0-home-light-non-newsletter-lang-drop__1___1_&view=b))

-   “I would probably try to ignore the ‘get involved’ bit, because you can get distracted by that.”
-   “So I am not sure if I would put the ‘get involved’ and ‘configure’ together with the ‘how it works’, because that is for the people who are more technical. As someone who only wants to login and enter experiences, I would not want to see the ‘configure’ and ‘get involved’.”
-   “I want to look only at ‘how it works’.”
-   “‘Authorise project’, what does that mean? Is that the consent-thing?”
-   “It is very distracting, because you tell me what the aims are, now I just want to login and upload. Why would I need to see all this straight up?”
-   “‘Authorise project’ - that is you authorising? That should go below ‘upload your experiences’, because you log in to Open Humans, you upload your experience and then you are authorising what I have uploaded.”
-   After explanation of authorisation of projects on OH:
-   “That means ‘give consent’, doesn’t it?”
-   “I would maybe put ‘authorise project’ in brackets and write ‘give consent’, because that describes in plain English what ‘authorise project’ means.”
-   “I know you have to make it legal, but you have to make it easy for us to understand.”
-   “The ‘get involved’, I would rather like that as a postscript, later, and the ‘configure’, again, more like a postscript.”
-   “The ‘how it works’ - it means, you have got to login to Open Humans, that is part of the login. That would be straight underneath ‘aims’, before the login-button.”
-   “I am not sure personally that I like the icon for ‘how it works’, because it looks like a ‘settings’ icon.”
- 
### Open Humans Login ([https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=oh-login&view=b](https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=oh-login&view=b))

-   “I am lazy, I would go straight with ‘continue with Google’ or ‘Facebook’.”  
-   Does not find being redirected to Open Humans confusing
    

### “Enter Experiences”-Site ([https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=3_-_add-event-across-device&view=b](https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=3_-_add-event-across-device&view=b))

-   Has seen the ‘enter experiences’ site before

##### Example of an experience:
-   “‘Where?’: Oxford Circus tube. And ‘what’: ‘trying to transfer to a different line, not using escalators, going by lift’ and ‘confusing signage’, is to which lift to use, because they are labelled A, B, C and so on. So I couldn’t follow it. I ended up going up, back, and back to where I started. I couldn’t understand, I had to ask other users and tell them where I wanted to go, because the signage doesn’t give you destination, it just says that it goes towards the line, but it doesn’t say where you’ll end up [...]. I just started getting upset, because I ended up by myself in the lift, and then I had to ask someone else. I came out and waited for someone else to use the lift and asked them. So, what would I have wished to be different? ‘Better signage’. So to say, like giving me a couple of sample destinations, so if you have got a sample destination on the signage saying ‘this is travelling west’, ‘this is travelling east’, then I know which lift to get into.” 

##### Is the choice of input fields appropriate?

-   “It is fine as long as the ‘what’ will expand itself as I type in.”
    

##### Personally ok with entering text?

-   yes
  

##### On more structure in the input form/more fields

-   “For me no, but other people might want some prompting. But I don’t even know if I’d ever press the ‘template’.
-   “I think in an early version it said something like ‘Did you find your own solution?’ or ‘How did you solve it?’, but you simplified it with ‘What would you have wished to be different?’, because some people were believing that we were exchanging points of view, putting in suggestions for the people, like ‘this is how I did it’. I think that is something that we should end up exchanging [...]. It would be nice if there was some form part that was like ‘transport’, ‘hospitals’, ‘school’, whatever it was, and people would go in and get advice from users. But I don’t know if that is the intention. You probably create the data and then it goes off into a report and then people at London transport will access it when it is finished.”
    

##### So would you like a tagging system for transport etc.?

-   “Yes I would, because it might minimise the horribleness that happens. For instance, I have always tried to advise people to not use the ‘i’-thing for help on the platforms, if you don’t like being buffeted by people. Because you try to use it standing on the platform and people are pushing you as you are trying to access it, and it is noisy and you can’t hear. They can’t hear you and you can’t hear them. It is a stupid method of getting help. I prefer to try and plan it or to see what other people have done. My son apparently said that there is somebody who has a podcast or YouTube videos that actually explain to use Oxford Circus. So I would probably put in at ‘What would you have wished to be different?’: ‘Follow this guy on YouTube’. And then everybody else who goes to Oxford Circus would think ‘alright, I am going to have a look at that.’”
    

  

##### Would you use the upload media function?

-   “As long as I am not in it and I am just showing the environment, possibly I could try. I wouldn’t ever try it on something as big as this [the tablet], but if it was with my phone, yes possibly. Because I google guide as a hobby, and I usually do that uploading afterwards. There are people confident to upload as they travel, because I have literally watched people google guide on trains, literally uploading every single venue as they go along, which I can’t do. [...] Whereas when I am writing, I’m trying to take someone through a story. When I am doing a video, I tend to get over-excitable and say all sorts of stuff that might not be entirely useful. So, I don’t know. Other people maybe shoot a video and never say a thing.”
    

##### Would you like to add any comment on the add event page?

-   “The navy is just a shade too dark. It is sort of making me think: ‘What are you? You are not black, not blue. [...] If it was a shade that was more towards a royal navy, that would be better.”
-   “[The contrast] is a little bit too heavy for me, but then I am short sighted, I am wearing my reading glasses. I don’t know if other people who got strong visual impairments would need that kind of contrast. I am just learning about this, that people with strong visual impairments do better with black background and yellow. So I don’t know if at any point of this ‘load up an experience’ you could have an alternative one, saying ‘do you have a visual impairment? Would you like to use this template?”
    

### Rating Scales ([https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=add-event-messaging&hi=1](https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=add-event-messaging&hi=1) → scroll to right)

-   “I don’t like the thermometer, because it makes me think of medical things.”
-   “Smileys personally, I don’t like them.”
-   “Happy locations, good locations, sad locations...I’d just put unhappy, I think unhappy looks like it is something that can be changed, sad looks like it is always going to be sad.”
-   “I don’t think I would even put ‘bad locations’, because it feels like underscoring. I’d just have the two positives and one negative one.”
-   “The location tag is familiar.”
-   “The color blue on this [the star rating scales] is alright, you should have it on the other site [the enter experience form].”
-   “Stars are fine.”
-   “No for ‘thumbs up’ and ‘thumbs down’. It feels slightly overused. I personally don’t like it.”
-   “I don’t know why to bother with the negative one, I would just have the heart. Maybe you could substitute the number of hearts with the number of stars.”
-   5-star rating but with hearts (suggestion by moderator):
	- “Yes I think you could do that easily and it would look quite nice, because it is not rating what you are eating, but it is rating your experience.”
    

### Views ([https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=5-event-views-together&view=b](https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=5-event-views-together&view=b))

##### Interpretation of the ‘views’ button on the ‘enter experience’ site:

-   “Whether it is viewable by others?”
- Suggestion for relabelling of ‘views’ button to make it clearer:  ‘viewing history”
    

##### Table view/list view

-   “I don’t like anything cellular.[...] It is mathematical to me. Other people may like it, and therefore enter one word and they like that. So I would just write ‘Do you like words or do you like cells to enter your experiences?’.”
-   “What does ‘view toggle’ mean?”
-   “I would say that the blue on this is right. Maybe slightly darker. If you use this in the background of the input form, then I think you’re doing ok.”
    

### Accessibility features ([https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=7-accessibility-across-devices](https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=7-accessibility-across-devices))

-   “Usually they [people with autism] request larger font sizes, because then there is less text on the site that they are reading and they can cope with it better.
-   confirms that screen reader is important
-   thinks that the symbol for accessibility is not so clear
-   positive towards alternative template and fonts as accessibility settings for people with visual impairments
    

# Concluding Questions

### Ease of use (Rating from 1 [very hard to use] to 5 [very easy to use])

-   “Because there are things to change: 3.”
    

### Likeliness of the participant using the platform once it is online (Rating from 1 [very unlikely] to 5 [very likely])

-   “4. I mean, I can’t promise because I have so much going on, but I am going to record all my hospital experience on this.”
    

### Feedback on user testing session

-   signature process is complicated. it should be possible to sign the consent form electronically
-   screen sharing did not work on iPad
-   If someone is not so used to using zoom, we should explain the screensharing before the session
    

### Further comments

##### Tagging system

-   “Just the fact that, obviously, this only being a flat process of putting stuff in, I would like at some stage for someone to sign it, so some of the experiences can be going into thematic categories. [..] So that everything that is related to transport or health, for hospital environments is extracted, so we can actually go in and look at that.”
-   Would like symbols for e.g. tubes, busses or hospitals as a support when picking tags
    

##### On the PECS symbols used on the ‘non-verbal’ site ([https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=3-add-event-non-verbal-home-final](https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=3-add-event-non-verbal-home-final)):

-   criticises ‘shop’ symbol (no text on sign) and expressions (hard to understand, “I think even emojis are better than that”)
