# Prototype

### Landing Page ([https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=0-home-light-non-newsletter-lang-drop__1___1_&view=b](https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=0-home-light-non-newsletter-lang-drop__1___1_&view=b))

-   “I find it quite glary, because it is really white and really bright. And I am strained looking at it, it is a bit too bright for me. It makes me want to look away.”
-   Theme does not need to be a dark theme, but “just not so bright. I think more about pastel colours. I find it hard to read on. I had a test once and they gave me a kind of ‘pinky’ background, which I found easier to read on. In my room I have it dark, so I don’t cope so well with bright light.”
-   “I would go on this website to find out things about autism or to help with it, but I cannot see where I could search for something. Normally you can see a search function right away.”
-   It is not clear that you can enter experiences on this site
-   Next step he would take: click on ‘Login’ button
    

### Open Humans Login ([https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=oh-login&view=b](https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=oh-login&view=b))

-   Unclear what Open Humans is and why you need to login there
-   “Having to login to Open Humans makes me a bit nervous. I would like more information before signing up and logging in, because you don’t really know what you are logging in for.”
    

### “Enter Experiences”-Site ([https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=3_-_add-event-across-device&view=b](https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=3_-_add-event-across-device&view=b))

-   “I find it quite confusing.”
-   “I am trying to work out what ‘Template’ means. I would like to have a picture of a template, so you actually see what a template is, so I don’t have to open it. Because if not, I would probably just ignore it, because I wouldn’t know what a template was if you didn’t explain it to me.”
-   ‘Where’ and ‘What’: “It took me some time, but I would understand it eventually.”
-   “I suppose ‘where’ is where you live, but I am not sure.”
-   “The ‘what’ - I would put my experience in there.”
-   “The ‘talk about any experience in your life’ needs to be bolder, because you don’t see it right away.”
    

##### Experience example

-   “I used to go to the gym years ago. And then they started [playing music], and I couldn’t cope with the music and the bass, because the new music has a lot of bass. And I was reaching out to the personnel there and asked if they could turn the bass down. [...] But they said that they didn’t know how to. Even when they turned the volume down, the bass kept driving me mad, it was having a bad effect on me. [...] Then I asked them if they could turn the music down altogether, but they wouldn’t do that. So my experience is that people won’t turn the music down. [...] I used to go to McDonalds, I used to go there in the morning for breakfast. And they started playing music in the restaurants and I can’t cope with the noise. [...] Everytime I ask the people that work there, they all just go ‘no’ [...] they are very negative towards me.”
    

##### Image/Video upload

-   “I would not like to upload a video of myself. Maybe just me talking, but not a video of my face.”
    

##### On input by writing text:

-   “I think I would find it quite difficult to enter the experience that I just described, because I have got bad dyslexia. It would be easier for me to speak, because if I would write, it would be very different from what I just said. My spelling is quite limited, so it would be just basic words and sentences. So I could not say what I would want to say, because I would have to write down what I can spell. I would have to think about writing a simpler version, because I struggle with writing.”
-   Would appreciate a voice-to-text function
-   “Reading makes me feel really stressed. It is not just reading, but also the anxiety that comes with reading and writing. I think people don’t understand that.” (also makes me feel tired)
    

### Rating Scales ([https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=add-event-messaging&hi=1](https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=add-event-messaging&hi=1) → scroll to right)

-   would prefer three smileys (too much choice if there are more)
-   ‘good locations’: “I don’t know what the one with the tick and the cross mean.”
    

# Concluding Questions

### Ease of use (Rating from 1 [very hard to use] to 5 [very easy to use])

-   “I think there is more work to be done. And I would appreciate pastel colors, because the screen is so bright. It is probably alright, it might be just the colouring. It might be good to have a colour bar to adapt the background.”
-   “The question [‘Talk about any experience in your daily life’] needs to be more highlighted, because I didn’t really understand right away what information you were looking for.”
    

### Likeliness of the participant using the platform once it is online (Rating from 1 [very unlikely] to 5 [very likely])

-   “As it is at the moment I would probably not use it, because I find the colours too intense. I found it a bit confusing, too.”
    

### Feedback on user testing session

-   “It was fine, ok. I think somebody who is not so experienced with computers might struggle.”
-   “I didn’t feel threatened or anything, I felt fine.”
-   Suggestion: Close the prototype-page-tree at the left side, because it is confusing
