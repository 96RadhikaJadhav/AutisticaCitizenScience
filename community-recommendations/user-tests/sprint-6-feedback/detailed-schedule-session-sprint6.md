# During the session

### Introduction & Formalities (Maybe organise a separate session with the participant to help them fill in the documents etc.)
-   Welcome
-   Ask if the participant has **read, filled in and signed** all the documents and if he has any questions or comments.
-   Possibly introduce the Autistica Citizen Science project, ask the participant about prior involvement and prior knowledge about the project. Show the project website if you like [https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/AutisticaCitizenScience/](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/AutisticaCitizenScience/)
-   [https://www.autistica.org.uk/our-research/our-research/your-research-priorities](https://www.autistica.org.uk/our-research/our-research/your-research-priorities)
-   Explain that we want to develop the platform together with people from the autistic community, which is why we are doing feedback sessions like this one
-   **Explain what the session will involve:**
	-   I will start and end the session with some general questions. For the main part, I will send you a link to open in your browser and to share your screen. This will be the link to a prototype ACSP (explain prototype) that I will guide you through with some little tasks. During the session, I would ask you to “think aloud”, that means to comment everything you do and to just say everything that comes to your mind.
-   Remind the participant that this user testing session is **not about measuring performance**. It is about improving the platform and making it easy to use by a wide range of people. Any feedback, positive or negative, is really valuable for us.
-   Make clear that they can **ask any question or raise any concern at any time**
-   Remind the user tester that they can **end the session at any time without having to give a reason**. Explain that they do **not need to answer any question** which they do not want to answer.
-   Verify if it is ok to **record the session**. Inform the participants that the audio file will not be uploaded anywhere, just a **summary with anonymised quotes** that the participant can verify before publication.
-   Explain that if they have **complaint** with the interviewer they can contact people from Autistica or the Whitaker Lab (as indicated on the consent form)
-   Explain that they have the option of emailing one of the facilitators if they have any additional points that they would like to share after the session ends.
-   Possibly screen sharing practice
-   Ask the user tester what you can do to make them **more comfortable** in the session.
    

### Testing Session

#### Introductory Questions

-   What is your connection to autism?
    
-   Do you regularly use computers or mobile devices (smartphone, tablet)? What do you use them for? (e.g. social media, online shopping, entertainment…)
    
-   Are there any accessibility tools or features that you use to access these sites?
    
-   Which devices would you probably use to input experiences with the Autistica Citizen Science Platform? (mobile, tablet, desktop)
    

#### Landing Page/Login/Define Profile

-   Send the following link to the participant, ask them to open it and share their screen. Alternatively, if they don’t want to/there are technical problems etc., you can open it and share your screen. Remind them that this is a prototype/wireframe and not a fully functioning website, so not every button will work as expected and some things might still be WIP

	-   [https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=0-home-light-non-newsletter-lang-drop__1___1_&view=b](https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=0-home-light-non-newsletter-lang-drop__1___1_&view=b)
    
-   Explain the following scenario:
    

	-   Think about a challenging experience that you/your child had in the past that was related to sensory input as you were going about your daily life. For example, think about noise, light, crowded places, transport, or whatever comes to your mind. You can also make something up. Imagine you would like to share this experience online via the Autistica Citizen Science platform.
    
	-   Please open the link and have a look at the landing page. Orient yourself on the page and read through the components in an order of your choice. Please “think aloud”, just tell us what comes to your mind, e.g. what you think the parts of the page mean and if everything is understandable. You can also comment structure and design, or anything else that comes to your mind. You will receive further instructions after that.
    
-   Is there anything missing or confusing?
    
-   Please activate the screen reader toggle [https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=0-home-light-screen-reader-toggle-final](https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=0-home-light-screen-reader-toggle-final) . Is it easy to use and understand? Do you find this function useful?
    

-   Ask the participant to click on “login” (tell them that in this scenario, they already have an account and do not need to sign up before). They will be guided to the Open Humans login [https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=oh-login&hi=1](https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=oh-login&hi=1) . Remind them to think aloud. If they are confused by the platform change, explain the intention.
    
-   Ask them to click on login. They will be guided to the define profile page [https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=2-define-profile](https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=2-define-profile) . Proceed as before.
    

-   Do you think the choice of profiles is appropriate? Is a profile missing? Which profile would you choose?
    
-   Why do you think you have to choose a profile?
    

-   Ask them to click on the “person” button.
    

#### Submission of User Experiences

-   They will be guided to this page: [https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=3_-_add-event-across-device&hi=1](https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=3_-_add-event-across-device&hi=1)
    
-   Please explain how you would enter your experience.
    
-   Do you think the fields are well chosen? Would you like to have other or additional input fields?
    
-   Would you like the possibility to upload images, videos or audio? Show [https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=3-add-event-upload](https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=3-add-event-upload)

-   If there was an option to choose the type of a location, what types would you think are useful?
    
-   If there was an option to choose tags or categories of experiences, what tags or categories would you find useful?
    

-   or would it be overwhelming?
    

-   We are thinking of integrating support functions for people who find it hard to write texts. Show [https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=3-add-event-non-verbal-home-final](https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=3-add-event-non-verbal-home-final)
    

-   Please have a look at this wireframe and tell us what you think.
    

-   Do you prefer the term “experience” or “event” or something else?
    
-   Please return to the “add-event-across device” page. Click on “views”.
    

#### Experiences/Event View

-   [https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=5-event-views-together](https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=5-event-views-together)
    
-   Let them have a look at the page and think aloud. Ask them to toggle between the views.
    

-   “My experiences” instead of views
    
-   Would you use both views? Why, why not?
    
-   Would you like to be able to filter the table in table view? By what categories?
    

-   Please click on “dashboard”
    

  

#### Dashboard (optional)

-   Dashboard
    

-   Explain that this site is still under construction, but ask them to orient themselves on the site and to go through the elements and think aloud.
    
-   [https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=4-dashboard-notifcations-user-stories&hi=1](https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=4-dashboard-notifcations-user-stories&hi=1)
    
-   Ask to click on accessibility
    

-   Accessibility
    

-   [https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=7-accessibility-across-devices](https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=7-accessibility-across-devices)
    
-   Are there any additional accessibility settings that would need to be integrated?
    

#### Concluding Questions

-   After seeing the wireframes, …
    

	-   ...how easy and intuitive do you find the platform? (1-5) → 1 hard, 5 easy
    
	-   ...how likely is it that you would use this platform once it is online? (1 not at all, 5 very likely)
    

-   If it is unlikely, please explain why. Would you change your mind if something was different?
    

-   What feedback would you give on this user testing session itself? Is there anything you would like us to change in the future?
    
-   Is there anything more you would like to add?
