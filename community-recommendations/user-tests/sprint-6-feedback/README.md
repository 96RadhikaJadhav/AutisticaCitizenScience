### What does this folder contain?

This folder contains **every participant's feedback** from the user testing sessions of sprint 6, a **summary** of all feedback, as well as a short and detailed **schedule** of the user testing session. There is also a **mindmap** (in .xmind and .png format) that we used to visualise the feedback in order to create issues more easily.

A **video summary** of the user feedback can be found here:

### How will this feedback be implemented?
The feedback has been transformed to issues here on GitHub, so that the development team gets a good overview of the changes to implement. The issues are tagged with '***Sprint-1-6-Feedback***'.
