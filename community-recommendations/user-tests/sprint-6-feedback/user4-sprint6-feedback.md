# Prototype

### Landing Page ([https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=0-home-light-non-newsletter-lang-drop__1___1_&view=b](https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=0-home-light-non-newsletter-lang-drop__1___1_&view=b))

-   Reads first the aims, then ‘How it works’
-   “Then I would have to log in, which is a bit stressful, because I don’t always know what all my login details are.”
-   “For me, it is just too much information. I mean, I realize it is really simple, but I guess that orange login-button is like a life-preserver, I would go for that.”
-   “I am sure the purpose of the website would be clear if I had the energy to read it. It is simple, but people get frustrated that it is not even more clear.”
-   “Visually it is very clean, but it is not very clear.”
-   “The text in the ‘How it works’ box should be one font size bigger.”
-   “There are different options to design it, I am just saying it is not the best it could be yet.”
-   “This landing page is giving you an overview of the site, but really it is trying to make it clear that you need to log in to begin. I think one thing that could be made better here is, apart from making that login more centered, is to change the label ‘login’ to ‘ready to begin’ or ‘proceed’ or something. [...] It is like when you are doing a questionnaire, like one of these surveys for your company, and it is going to be like 100 questions and you just click ‘proceed’. It is very linear thinking, it is like ‘Ok, now I am just going to the next page.’. It proceeds in a linear fashion. As opposed to being on this landing page, and thinking ‘Alright, there are 12 sections and I don’t know where I want to start. I guess it is up to me. Like, I don’t really want to choose my own adventure, I want you to tell me the order[...], because that is easier for me. When I am at home, organising my bookshelf, I get to choose how I am going to organise it. And there are a million ways to do it and that is my choice, and I can struggle with that and use my energy for that. But when I am coming to this site, I just want you to tell me where I need to go next. Like with this session: Just tell me what I need to do. I need to save my energy for after this session.”
    

### Open Humans Login ([https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=oh-login&view=b](https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=oh-login&view=b))

-   “It is pretty straight-forward. [...]I have come to expect these alternative logins with Facebook and Google, that is just how things are these days, but I usually try to avoid third-party logins. But now I would have to find my login details.”
    

##### Is it confusing to be forwarded to the Open Humans login?

-   “Yes, I was just going to say that. I struggle with the organisations. I mean there is Turing..I don’t really know what Open Humans is. I have heard that phrase many times, I am sure that I have been told, but I don’t know. It is some kind of platform - but I don’t even know what a platform is, I am not a technical person. So that is a problem. But I would think here, if I had already signed up before, I would just look up the login details in my notes. I wouldn’t know what Open Humans is, but I have heard this terminology before.”
    

### “Enter Experiences”-Site ([https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=3_-_add-event-across-device&view=b](https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=3_-_add-event-across-device&view=b))

-   “What I understand from the site is that the main essence of it is that it was created to log people’s challenging experiences.”
    

##### Example of an experience

-   Experience at a restaurant
-   Where: “I would write that I was at a restaurant at the inn I was staying on Friday night.”
-   What: “There was outdoor seating at the end, at the courtyard. People were really loud, they were drunk and everything, so I was trying to get a table that was far away from them. They put me in the corner by the toilets, and I had to go to my room to get my earplugs and I put those in as well. And then it was ok and the people left eventually.”
-   “The staff at the hotel was helpful in accommodating me and finding a spot that was more comfortable for me and I think they understood. I said that I had misophonia. I don’t think they know what it means, but I said that I struggle with my noise sensitivity.”
-   What I would have wished to be different: “I think it was handled pretty well. I think they didn’t have indoor seating because of covid, everything was outdoors, but they did actually say after a while that if I did want more, that they could find me a table inside. Which I think was a good compromise, even though they have certain health standards right now because of covid. But I think we talked it out pretty good and they were pretty understanding to come up with different solutions. Because many people were seated closely together outdoors, they could have maybe taken a step to tell the other clients to be a little quieter. I think they just didn’t want to do that because they don’t want to tell anybody to be quiet, because they are having a good time. So it was rather me who had to adjust instead of the other people.”
-   “I guess what is in dark blue is active.” (when inspecting the buttons ‘upload’ and ‘non-verbal’)
    

##### Upload media:

-   “I don’t know what ‘upload’ means. I think I have to upload in the end. I don’t know how ‘upload’ is different than ‘submit’. ‘Submit’ speaks for itself, so ‘click it in the end when you are done’, but I don’t know why there is an upload there.”
-   “The upload images-function should be more within it [the input form]. Because when it is within it, it implies ‘add more specificity’ to what you have written. When it is outside, it looks like you are changing the accessibility settings of this page.”
    

##### The choice of fields:

-   “It is pretty good, it covers the basics.”
-   “I think you don’t want the word ‘what’ to be used twice, even though they are in different sections. Because it is in different sections, I think it is ok, but I think you could probably improve it by changing the second ‘what’ maybe to ‘how’, to even make it more clear that it is a different section.
-   “The question in the second box could be something like ‘How could this situation have been different?”
-   “I guess there is always more that you could add, you could add more questions, but then it gets too long for people. So I think it is ok.”
    

##### Entering text:

-   “I would generally be ok with this format, but I can see how some people maybe would want to just speak to describe the situation rather than having to type it all. Either because they are not so comfortable with writing or because there is a lot of nuance in the situation they are describing and they could give you that much more colour by doing it on audio. In that way you could take from it what you wish.”
    

##### Templates

-   “I am not really sure what that means. It suggests to me that maybe when I am not comfortable from an accessibility standpoint with typing in all these boxes, then maybe if I click on ‘templates’ there was another format in which I could enter my experience. But I probably would not click on that, because I am quite comfortable with using the format which is right in front of me, which is just a typing box.”
    

##### Terms ‘event’ and ‘experience’:

-   “Throughout the platform, sometimes you use the words ‘event’ and ‘experiences’ synonymously.”
-   “I think ‘experience’ is better than ‘event’, because ‘event’ sounds a bit more formal, or it is like ‘you went to an event’. I think out of those two, ‘experience’ is a bit better. My advice would be to use ‘experience’ instead of ‘event’, that is my first point. My second point would be, if it is not implied in the first point, ‘don’t use both throughout the site’, try to eliminate the other, whichever you choose. And is there another word that would be better than either of them? I have to think about it.”.
-   ‘In regards to the points on terminology of “Event” or “Experience”, I still think the latter is preferable (“Experience”). Furthermore, you could decide if only negative experiences are being requested (if so make this clear), or both positive or negative. (I think only negative experience should be captured, but I suppose this is dependent on the predetermined scope of this overall project. If both, then the first question should be: “Was this experience positive or negative?” (tick appropriate box), “Description of experience”:  (free form text box)’

### Rating Scales ([https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=add-event-messaging&hi=1](https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=add-event-messaging&hi=1) → scroll to right)

-   “Aren’t these supposed to be all bad experiences or can you enter good experiences as well?”
-   “I think these binary options with two or three choices are not enough. You won’t get accurate feedback, the data is going to be too skewed. It is like ‘Was it a good or bad girlfriend? I don’t know, we split up, but the experience I had was great, I think she was great, but it just didn’t work out.’. So I think you need to have something with more choices, like 1 out of 10 or something. But even then, like, if you had 5 options, how would you rate it? It could still be problematic, because if I wrote a negative experience, what is the type of the negative experience? Am I rating ‘was it a 1 negative or a 5 negative?’. You would need to be clearer. What I sometimes see in surveys, what I think is pretty good, it says like ‘1 to 10’ and then it has words to explain what it means, like 5 is ‘normal’ and 10 is ‘positive’. It has some words to describe what each rating would mean, in the direction of good or bad. So, I think you would need more choices and also some words to explain, what those mean as well.”
-   “I would basically say all these options here are bad and I would eliminate them all, you would just need to find a better option. It is easy for me to say, because I am not a designer. But you don’t need to reinvent the wheel on a website. All these companies making websites, like Apple with the Apple store for example, they figured out how to rate an app. You could get inspiration there.”
-   “There are some good examples of ratings that I have used, they are vaguely in my head. I know it was still hard to decide whether it is a 7 or a 9, because it is a subjective decision, but at least it was clear how the rating system works. I would say that you should keep looking for a better rating system.” 
-  Perhaps use scale something like this: [https://www.prohealth.com/library/what-the-pain-scale-really-means-34982](https://www.prohealth.com/library/what-the-pain-scale-really-means-34982) 
    

### Views ([https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=5-event-views-together&view=b](https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=5-event-views-together&view=b))

##### Interpretation of the ‘views’ button on the ‘enter experience’ site:

-   “It is probably just, if I want this screen to visually look a little bit different, maybe in a different format that would be a little more pleasing, less stimulating or more appropriate for me, while keeping the same content. Or it might mean ‘View all of my responses from before’, so ‘view’ like ‘everything I have written’. But I think it is probably the former.”
-   “I don’t know if that word, ‘views’, is the right word, even though I guessed it.”
-   “Intuitively, I don’t think there is a great word to put there that everyone will understand, but I could look around. It is not a common feature of websites that you can go back to your complete log, but there has got to be some example out there.”
    

##### table view and list view

-   “I remember seeing this before and being asked this question before.”
-   “I think generally it is good that you are giving people several options. I think that the toggle is pretty clear. I think that the words ‘table’ and ‘list’ are pretty clear. I think ‘table’ and ‘list’ is quite clean, but you might change it to ‘list view’ and ‘table view’. Just adding the word ‘view’ might make it a lot more clear what the toggle on top is giving you a choice of. The word toggle is there on the left, so it is already implied, although then it becomes a little bit awkward, because here is the word ‘view toggle’. You could remove ‘view’ from there and then add it to ‘table view’ or ‘list view’.”
-   “I think having options is good, I think the details of the table look pretty well laid out. The list format is a little bit unclear, because it doesn’t have any gridlines, so I think the list could be a bit more formatted with a little bit more boxes and underlines and so on. It looks a lot like a lot of words smushed together for me. Obviously, there was an effort made to distinguish, by using colours, but it is unlike the table, which is just a little more clean.”
-   “Having something in list form is great, and you have that, which is good. I just think the actual formatting could be a little more distinguished.”
    

# Concluding Questions

### Ease of use (Rating from 1 [very hard to use] to 5 [very easy to use])

-   “It is going in the right direction. It is pretty streamlined. Like I said before, remove a lot of the excess, less is more, make it very stripped down. It seems like a lot of it has been done already. The pages are pretty clean compared to typical websites, where you have got adverts and information everywhere. So maybe it is a 4, but for now I’d say that it is a 3.”
    

### Likeliness of the participant using the platform once it is online (Rating from 1 [very unlikely] to 5 [very likely])

-   5
-   “I have a commitment of helping out with the project, once it is live, as a user. It is done well enough that I am confident that I can sort of use it and not have too much of a meltdown or use up too much energy, so I would give it a go.”
    

### Feedback on user testing session

-   signature process is complicated. it should be possible to sign the consent form electronically
-   “I use zoom a lot for my work, so it is fine” → other people might find it difficult
-   well run
