# Prototype

### Landing Page ([https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=0-home-light-non-newsletter-lang-drop__1___1_&view=b](https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=0-home-light-non-newsletter-lang-drop__1___1_&view=b))

-   “I like how it is broken down into smaller sections, with borders around each box. I like the fact that they are separate, and that the links are highlighted.”
-   “I would use the ‘How it works’, definitely. And I would like to see an example of how you would write that experience. It could be anonymous, but it could have a picture of how it would look. That would be useful.”
-   “I like the ‘Configure’ and ‘Get involved’-parts. I think it is not overcrowded and it is not too long.”
-   “I like the detail and the layout of this section.”
    

### Open Humans Login ([https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=oh-login&view=b](https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=oh-login&view=b))

-   “I like this page. It may seem plain, but I do like the actual thoughts, because it is not too advanced. It is very clean, it definitely can work. Very easy to understand and accessible I would say. And it allows you to use Google or Facebook just in case.”
-   “I like the plain but simple access to login. Plus, logging into other supported pages.”
    

##### The fact of being redirected to Open Humans:

-   “I don’t find it confusing. I like the fact that it allows you to use your username or email. I would recognize these, it is positive.”
-   “I believe it was mentioned beforehand to me.”
    

### “Enter Experiences”-Site ([https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=3_-_add-event-across-device&view=b](https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=3_-_add-event-across-device&view=b))

##### Form fields

-   “For the entering experiences. I like the use of where or what. But, would it be worth adding how, why. As well as time of day - what I mean by this was weather. For e.g. sunny, windy, rainy, cold?”
    

##### Example of an experience:

-   “Whenever I go on public transport, especially at peak times, it can be quite challenging and it is very off-putting, I would like to avoid it completely to travel during peak times.”
-   “If I could change one thing about the use of public transport I go on, it would probably be a higher frequency of trains, maybe every 8 or 10 minutes, so there are not so many people that go on each train.”
    

##### Layout

-   “I do like the layout of it and the content of the site. Maybe a field for ‘other’ would be useful, because maybe if there is something you can’t fit into the ‘Where’ or ‘What’ section, you can maybe add that to that ‘other’ part, which would be useful. I do like it overall.”
    

##### Upload-media:

-   Interpretation of the ‘upload’-button:
	-   “I think once you entered the event, you can upload it to the database.”
-   “I think pictures can be useful. I think somebody mentioned it to me before, so it doesn’t come as a surprise. It takes you back, but in a good way and could help other users to engage. If you would have an upload-section, I would rephrase it to something like ‘Upload by image only’ or ‘Upload by text only’ or ‘Upload by audio’.”
    

##### Text entry:

-   Would be ok for him
    

### Rating Scales ([https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=add-event-messaging&hi=1](https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=add-event-messaging&hi=1) → scroll to right)

-   “Rating scales would be useful to have some comparison to. As well as, give each star or emoticon a brief label or description.”
-   “I like the idea of using the emojis. I like the one with three emojis a lot, because I think it is simple, but effective to use to get that kind of feedback.”
-   “I think the stars would be useful, I like the stars. If you add explanations, like 1 being ‘not good’ and 5 being the highest, that would help. I like the idea.”
-   “I think I prefer the stars over the emojis.”
-   “I’d say I would prefer 5 options. If there was a description of what the stars mean, that could be very useful. But I like the idea.”
-   Suggestion of stars with emoji faces (by Katharina):
	-   “would also be an idea”
-   “Rating scale – have a history or record of it of how it compares e.g. data or graph, bar chart, pie chart?”
-   “Use of numbers or stars (one being lowest, five the highest).”
-   “Emoticons (a face that represents the event or experience).”
-   “Temperature (was this a cold or hot situation).”
-   “Tick/cross selection?, For examples thumbs up, thumbs down.”
    

##### Tags for experiences

-   tags that would be useful: transport, covid (at the moment), other, not applicable
-   “A word or phrase [referring to tags to allow more options] – drop down selection with explanation of what it means.”
    

### Views ([https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=5-event-views-together&view=b](https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=5-event-views-together&view=b))

##### Interpretation of the ‘Views’-button on the ‘Enter experience’ site
-   “Other views [experiences] from other users.”
    

##### General

-   “To understand the context of the experiences, having a scale there, from 1 to 5 or emoticons, would that be something to consider?”
    

##### Terms “experience/event”

-   “I do like the wording of ‘event’ or ‘experience’. I think people tend to use ‘experience’ more, but ‘event’ can have the same kind of meaning.”
    

##### Table view

-   “I think it is a template of someone to express overall how their experiences were, like on a daily basis.”
-   “Initially, when I looked at it, I would have had the idea to fill it in, but I think it was understood from my part.”
-   “I do like it, but as you write, will the grid bend? When you put in the text, this could be altered or changed.”
    

##### List view

-   “I like it, but I would like to have a symbol to represent the severity of how challenging or difficult it was. It could be by stars or emoji faces. This would give more depth and meaning. Otherwise I think it is ok. Apart from that, I would like an ‘other’ section.”
    

  

# Concluding Questions

### Ease of use (Rating from 1 [very hard to use] to 5 [very easy to use])

-   4
    

### Likeliness of the participant using the platform once it is online (Rating from 1 [very unlikely] to 5 [very likely])

-   5
-   “I like to think of this as a platform that is inviting and easy to use and navigate, maybe something different but in a good way. Something that entices you to use it over and over again, but in a good way.”
    

### Further comments

-   “I overall liked the list and table view. But I would like to expand it. What I saw in a nice way was: nice colours, it was warm. The text was nice, it wasn’t too big or too harsh. I think the use of a rating, like emojis or stars would be nice to further express the event or experience.”
-   “A tutorial of how the site works would be an option.”
-   “Overall I think it would be very useful to have that [the ACSP].”
-   “I think it would be good to have more pictures.”
-   “For the stars, I think if you write next to add that 1 is the lowest and 5 is the highest option, I don’t know if all people would be able to or would like to use it in that way. So I think the emojis might be the better option.”
-   “Show a guide/example of how the page will appear.”
-   “Alternatively, use of accessibility tools.”
-   “Analysis or summary of what the page is. For example, read by audio or video.”
-   “Overall, I like all the details and structure across the different areas.”
