# Prototype

### Landing Page ([https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=0-home-light-non-newsletter-lang-drop__1___1_&view=b](https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=0-home-light-non-newsletter-lang-drop__1___1_&view=b))

-   “I would probably go to ‘login’ and register.”
-   “The first thing I read was the slogan. [...] Then I looked at ‘aims’, read them, and I didn’t really pay attention to ‘How it works’, ‘Configure’ and ‘Get involved’, because it looks like technical information, and then I went basically to ‘Login’.”
-   “I spent some time reading the slogan, because I was trying to understand whether it summarises everything or why it is there.”
-   “It doesn’t look particularly confusing, although I don’t know why there is so much information on the landing page.”
    

### Open Humans Login ([https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=oh-login&view=b](https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=oh-login&view=b))

-   Being forwarded to the Open Humans login did not confuse her
    

### “Enter Experiences”-Site ([https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=3_-_add-event-across-device&view=b](https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=3_-_add-event-across-device&view=b))

#### With regard to the instruction “Talk about any experience in your daily life”:

-   “What is important to understand here is that I think everyone on the spectrum has their daily life heavily adjusted to avoid situations which they could describe here. So like for example, we don’t go to hotels or restaurants anymore, because they are not suitable for highly sensitive children. So when you ask about ‘daily life’, our daily life is very different from what you probably think about daily life. But I can enter events from the past, which influenced these decisions, like meltdowns or anything that leads to basically rejecting attendance to those places. The thing is, that after you’ve had those ‘failures’ and you understand that it is just not adjusted to you, your life is very different, and only when you do something new, you can get in some sort of ‘trouble’ on a daily basis. But living with sensory sensitivities means, it used to be almost like some kind of military operation, that was carefully calculated and evaluated. So I wouldn’t say ‘daily life’, because our daily life is highly structured, or ‘protected’ in any way possible. No one takes risks.”
-   “Yes, there are daily things, but what you have to expect from many people is that they have adjusted their life, because it would be too traumatic to have a meltdown on a daily basis.”
-   Ideas for alternative formulation:
	-   we should specify what we are looking for, e.g.: “general experiences that influenced your attitude to life”
	-   “What makes something a barrier or accessible” (Comment from moderator)
    

##### Example of an experience:

-   Children go to school half an hour earlier to avoid crowded entries
-   “The whole morning experience should be more sensory friendly for all children, because they all stress out. It is just that their levels of tolerance are higher than ours.”
-   “If I was entering, I would say ‘Where: primary school’, ‘What: The beginning of the day, registration’, and ‘What would you have wished to be different: I would wish there was more structure.’ With the lockdown, they introduced a lot of structure to the activities and I found it so much easier. For example, in school they put daisy flowers where everyone could queue and everyone kept a distance. And I was thinking that was a brilliant idea.”
-   “I would like things to be less busy, more organised, more visual support.”
    

##### Feedback to form

-   Interpretation of the disk-symbol in the left upper corner: ‘data storage’
-   “The form doesn’t invite sophistication.”
-   “This form gives you the impression of ‘don’t go too deep with your thoughts. Just tell very briefly, very easy to understand and follow what you think’.”
-   “Looks like the results will be shown in some kind of excel table, which will be manually analysed by someone.”
-   “It looks a bit old fashioned - you have an input, and then it is presented to you as a table.”
-   “This form doesn’t reflect any sort of achievements in visual representation made for autistic people, I mean, when design encourages you to think. When it is not only words, which tell you what to do and what the person is looking for, but also some visuals, like something that helps.”
-   “You could have a face which could indicate ‘Imagine a situation in your daily life, when some experience has happened’ and you could have a thinking face next to it. Or when you go ‘Where, what..’, you could also provide some pictures indicating location or indicating ‘experience’. On the very basic level it could be like the PECS, the picture language used for autistic people. I don’t really like PECS very much, I think they are not very attractive. But the idea is that you add more visuals rather than overload it with words.”
-   “In my family, autism is high-functioning, so we don’t need serious accommodations. But we did need help with speech and all of that. But the thing is that the senses of my children are different to some extent. So for them, to get the maximum out of information, it is best when they use as many senses as they possibly can. So when you read the text, one brain area is activated, when you look at pictures, another area. If there is voice explanation, it would be a third one. The more resilient the form is, the more ‘avenues’ it uses, the better.”
-   “None of them likes reading. They [her children] are all very creative about using voice to text, using voice commands. They don’t really use screen readers, but if there is an option to listen, to command, they would rather do that.”

##### Upload-button:

-   she would generally appreciate the possibility of media upload
-   ‘upload’ is not really clear
-   “What is important to remember about autistic people, is that they question everything. You think it is obvious? It is not. They will give you ten different explanations on how they understood it.”
    

##### Non-verbal input:

-   “This is another extreme, I was talking about text being complemented by visuals.”

##### Terms ‘experience’ and ‘event’:

-   “experience is good”
    

### Rating Scales ([https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=add-event-messaging&hi=1](https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=add-event-messaging&hi=1) → scroll to right)

-   “I think it depends on the data you would like to collect, because when we talk about ‘good location’ that would probably mean ‘it was alright, nothing went wrong’. A ‘happy location’ would probably be something where people went beyond usual expectations and there was something thoughtful that made you smile. So for me ‘good’ and ‘happy’ are different. But I think it needs some guidance on what you mean exactly. Some places look nice, but they are just not good for us. I wouldn’t call that a bad location.”
-   Recommends to rather rate experiences than locations: “Experiences can change, today it was like this, tomorrow it might be better.”
  

### Views ([https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=5-event-views-together&view=b](https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=5-event-views-together&view=b))

-   Interpretation of the ‘Views’-button on the ‘Enter experience’ page
	-   “Maybe other people’s views”
    

-   List view
	-   “This is your feed from the website. So basically what other people said. It is not very exciting to see it this way. But I guess for people who work with it it is fine. I mean, for me, I probably would not go through it out of interest.”
	-   “If the experiences of other people were in the same place where I enter my experiences, I might be interested to read. It is almost like a restaurant review. You would want to read the comments to see whether other people think the same. Or before you go it would be interesting to read the comments to see what to expect and to decide whether you want to go or not. So I think it is almost like a rating for the place.”
	-   It is confusing that there is no text under some of the “What would you have liked to be different?” questions:
	-   confusing, looks like you invite someone to comment
	-   “If there is no input, there should be something saying ‘no information’”
    

-   Table view
	-   Preference of table or list view depends on the use case
    

  

### Accessibility features ([https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=7-accessibility-across-devices](https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=7-accessibility-across-devices))

-   Suggestion: Possibility to change the colour scheme
-   “The problem with screen readers is that they just start from the beginning and when it reaches the point you need, a lot of time has passed. It would be better if there was a button that would read you a particular block of text that you want. It is for people who can see the text and are not blind, but who feel like this could help them to understand.”
    

# Concluding Questions

### Ease of use (Rating from 1 [very hard to use] to 5 [very easy to use])

-   When design is improved: between 2 and 3. → Good start, but needs some refining
-   Accessibility symbol (man with open arms) is not easy to understand
-   “If there is any visual accompanying the text, people will always draw conclusions, because it is faster to analyse the visuals than to read the text. So it gives you a direction. I think for ‘accessibility’ there are other signs that are more self-explanatory.”
    

### Likeliness of the participant using the platform once it is online (Rating from 1 [very unlikely] to 5 [very likely])

-   “5, because I will use it no matter what, because I believe in the great value of having it. But it is not because of design features, but of the overall opportunity.”
  

### Feedback on user testing session

-   “Nice experience”
-   “I deal a lot with autistic people, so in my life I have to be really clear in what I say, because of the opportunities for misunderstanding.”
    

### Further comments

-   “Judging by my children, if you use voice more, either reading it to you or input by voice, that would definitely increase participation of types like my children.”
