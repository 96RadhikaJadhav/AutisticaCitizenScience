# How to prepare and conduct an online 1:1 user testing session

**Before you read this 'how to':** This is only one way of doing user testing sessions. You can of course adapt this schedule to your needs. But keep in mind to stick to the requirements stated in the [study protocol](https://github.com/katoss/AutisticaCitizenScience/blob/master/project-management/legal-and-ethical-compliance/ethics-applications/stage-1-co-design-phase/A9_StudyProtocol.pdf "A9_StudyProtocol.pdf") of the project's **ethics application**.

## Before the session
### 1. Create a schedule for your user testing session
What features of the prototype would you like to get feedback on? 
- You can find a template for a user testing session here: [template-online-user-testing-session.md](https://github.com/katoss/AutisticaCitizenScience/blob/master/community-recommendations/user-tests/template-online-user-testing-session.md)
- As an example, here is the detailed schedule of the user testing sessions for sprint 6: [detailed-schedule-session-sprint6.md](https://github.com/katoss/AutisticaCitizenScience/blob/master/community-recommendations/user-tests/sprint-6-feedback/detailed-schedule-session-sprint6.md "detailed-schedule-session-sprint6.md")
### 2. Find and invite participants

 - Effort should be made to be inclusive of a diverse population. This includes representing ethnic and socio-economic diversity, diversity of gender identification and sexual orientation, representing people from across the autistic spectrum, and being inclusive of people with caring responsibilities and people with disabilities. Groups should include a mixture of autistic people and families and carers of autistic people (Information taken from the [study protocol](https://github.com/katoss/AutisticaCitizenScience/blob/master/project-management/legal-and-ethical-compliance/ethics-applications/stage-1-co-design-phase/A9_StudyProtocol.pdf "A9_StudyProtocol.pdf")) 
 - A template for an invitation email can be found here: [template-email-invitation.md](https://github.com/katoss/AutisticaCitizenScience/blob/master/community-recommendations/user-tests/template-email-invitation.md "template-email-invitation.md")
 - The documents that are referred to in the email invitation can be found here:
	 - [Consent form](https://github.com/katoss/AutisticaCitizenScience/blob/master/project-management/legal-and-ethical-compliance/ethics-applications/stage-1-co-design-phase/A6_ConsentForm.pdf "A6_ConsentForm.pdf")
	 - [Participant information sheet](https://github.com/katoss/AutisticaCitizenScience/blob/master/project-management/legal-and-ethical-compliance/ethics-applications/stage-1-co-design-phase/A7_ParticipantInformationSheet.pdf "A7_ParticipantInformationSheet.pdf")
	 - [Code of conduct](https://github.com/katoss/AutisticaCitizenScience/blob/master/project-management/legal-and-ethical-compliance/ethics-applications/stage-1-co-design-phase/A3_CodeOfConduct.pdf "A3_CodeOfConduct.pdf")

	 - Payment form (contact Bethan Davis from Autistica at discover@autism.org.uk) (?)

### 3. If requested, do a 'Introduction and Formalities' session
Ask the participant if they are comfortable with reading and signing the documents (see 2.) and with your online conferencing tool and screen sharing. If requested, conduct an 'Introduction and formalities' session with them, in which you help them go through and sign the documents and explain how to use the online conferencing tool.

## During the session
### 1. Start the online conference (e.g with zoom) with your participant and introduce the session
- Make sure the participant has read the documents and signed the consent form
-  Tell the participant what the session will involve (see the 'Introduction' part of the [schedule of sprint 6](https://github.com/katoss/AutisticaCitizenScience/blob/master/community-recommendations/user-tests/sprint-6-feedback/detailed-schedule-session-sprint6.md "detailed-schedule-session-sprint6.md") as an example)
### 3. Start recording the session
- This is very important to be able to summarise the session later on. 
- Don't forget to ask the participant for their consent. If they don't feel comfortable with recording the session, you (or another person who joins the session) has to take notes during the session.
### 4. Follow the schedule of your session
- See the 'Testing session' part of the [schedule of sprint 6](https://github.com/katoss/AutisticaCitizenScience/blob/master/community-recommendations/user-tests/sprint-6-feedback/detailed-schedule-session-sprint6.md "detailed-schedule-session-sprint6.md") as an example

### 5. End the recording and inform the participant about the next steps

## After the session

***Mandatory steps from the [study protocol](https://github.com/katoss/AutisticaCitizenScience/blob/master/project-management/legal-and-ethical-compliance/ethics-applications/stage-1-co-design-phase/A9_StudyProtocol.pdf "A9_StudyProtocol.pdf"):***

 1. File the consent forms and invoice forms securely in Autistica's London offices.
 2. Pay participants for their time directly into the participants' bank account, using the invoicing details they provided.
 3. Make notes on insights gathered from the session ensuring that they do not contain any personally identifying information. Try using as many original quotes of the participants as possible. You can find examples of summaries (e.g. 'user1-sprint6-feedback') in this folder: [sprint-6-feedback](https://github.com/katoss/AutisticaCitizenScience/tree/master/community-recommendations/user-tests/sprint-6-feedback "sprint-6-feedback").
 4. Send summarised insights from the sessions to the user tester and the core research team.
 5. Allow the user tester two weeks to request comments to be redacted or rephrased. You can use this email template ([template-email-feedback-request.md](https://github.com/katoss/AutisticaCitizenScience/blob/master/community-recommendations/user-tests/template-email-feedback-request.md "template-email-feedback-request.md")) to ask the participants for feedback. 
 6. Redact or rephrase the summary according to the participants request and in line with the [code of conduct](https://github.com/katoss/AutisticaCitizenScience/blob/master/project-management/legal-and-ethical-compliance/ethics-applications/stage-1-co-design-phase/A3_CodeOfConduct.pdf "A3_CodeOfConduct.pdf").
 7. After four weeks make the summary document public at the project's dedicated GitHub repository ([https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/tree/master/project-management](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience)).
	 - Create a new folder in the [user-tests](https://github.com/katoss/AutisticaCitizenScience/tree/master/community-recommendations/user-tests "user-tests") directory,  and put the summaries there 
	- For example, see the folder [sprint-6-feedback](https://github.com/katoss/AutisticaCitizenScience/tree/master/community-recommendations/user-tests/sprint-6-feedback "sprint-6-feedback")
 8. The summary document will remain publicly available, and licensed for reuse by anyone, so long as they credit the Autistica/Turing citizen science community.

***Further steps:***

1. Create a summary of your notes from all participants of this run of user tests
	- For example, see [summary-sprint6-feedback.md](https://github.com/katoss/AutisticaCitizenScience/blob/master/community-recommendations/user-tests/sprint-6-feedback/summary-sprint6-feedback.md "summary-sprint6-feedback.md")
2. Use this summary to **transform the feedback to issues on GitHub**
	- This step is very important to assure that the user feedback will be implemented in the following sprints
