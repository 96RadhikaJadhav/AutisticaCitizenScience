# How to prepare and conduct an online 1:1 user testing session
! This is still a work in progress
**Before you read this 'how to':** This is only one way of doing user testing sessions. You can of course adapt this schedule to your needs. But keep in mind to stick to the requirements stated in the **ethics application** [ADD DOCUMENT LINK]

## Before the session
### 1. Create a schedule for your user testing session
What features of the prototype would you like to get feedback on? 
- You can find a template for a user testing session here: [template-online-user-testing-session.md](https://github.com/katoss/AutisticaCitizenScience/blob/master/community-recommendations/user-tests/template-online-user-testing-session.md)
- As an example, here is the detailed schedule of the user testing sessions for sprint 6: [detailed-schedule-session-sprint6.md](https://github.com/katoss/AutisticaCitizenScience/blob/master/community-recommendations/user-tests/sprint-6-feedback/detailed-schedule-session-sprint6.md "detailed-schedule-session-sprint6.md")
### 2. Find and invite participants

 - Try to recruit a diverse group of participants [ADD LINK]
 - A template for an invitation email can be found here: [template-email-invitation.md](https://github.com/katoss/AutisticaCitizenScience/blob/master/community-recommendations/user-tests/template-email-invitation.md "template-email-invitation.md")
 - The documents that are referred to in the email invitation can be found here:

### 3. If requested, do a 'Introduction and Formalities' session
Ask the participant if they are comfortable with reading and signing the documents (see 2.) and with your online conferencing tool and screen sharing. If requested, conduct an 'Introduction and formalities' session with them, in which you help them go through and sign the documents and explain how to use the online conferencing tool.

## During the session
### 1. Start the online conference (e.g with zoom) with your participant
### 2.  Make sure the participant has signed the consent form and start with the 'Introduction' of your schedule and
### 3. Start recording the session
### 4. Follow the schedule of your session
### 5. End the recording and inform the participant about the next steps


## After the session
### 1. Summarise the recorded session
- Summarise the session according to topics
- Try using as many original quotes of the participants as possible
- You can find examples of summaries (e.g. 'user1-sprint6-feedback') in this folder: [sprint-6-feedback](https://github.com/katoss/AutisticaCitizenScience/tree/master/community-recommendations/user-tests/sprint-6-feedback "sprint-6-feedback")

### 2. Send the participant the summary and ask them if they would like you to change anything
- Here is a template of an email requesting feedback from the participants: [template-email-feedback-request.md](https://github.com/katoss/AutisticaCitizenScience/blob/master/community-recommendations/user-tests/template-email-feedback-request.md "template-email-feedback-request.md")
### 3. Once you got the participant's consent, upload the summary to GitHub
- Create a new folder in [user-tests](https://github.com/katoss/AutisticaCitizenScience/tree/master/community-recommendations/user-tests "user-tests"),  and put the summaries there 
- For example, see the folder [sprint-6-feedback](https://github.com/katoss/AutisticaCitizenScience/tree/master/community-recommendations/user-tests/sprint-6-feedback "sprint-6-feedback")
### 4. Make sure the participant gets paid for the session
- Participants get paid via Autistica. Contact Bethan (ADD MAIL) for details
### 5. Create a summary of all summaries of this run of user tests
- For example, see [summary-sprint6-feedback.md](https://github.com/katoss/AutisticaCitizenScience/blob/master/community-recommendations/user-tests/sprint-6-feedback/summary-sprint6-feedback.md "summary-sprint6-feedback.md")
### 6. Use this summary to transform the feedback to issues on GitHub
- This step is very important to assure that the user feedback will be implemented in the following sprints
