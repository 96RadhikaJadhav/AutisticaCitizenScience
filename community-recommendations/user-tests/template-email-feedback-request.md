**Dear [NAME],**

Thank you so much for your participation in our user test! It is a priority of the Autistica Citizen Science project to develop the platform not only for, but also together with people from the community, so your feedback is really valuable for us.

Here is the link to the summary of your user testing session:
[[ADD LINK]](https://...)

**At the moment, only [ADD NAMES] have access to it.**

Please read the document and tell us if there is anything that you would like us to change or remove before publication on GitHub.

There may be comments that are incorrect, where I have misunderstood what you said. It is important that we correct these mistakes and that you are confident that the summary document accurately reflects your input from the user testing session.

There may also be comments that are correct but that you do not feel comfortable having publicly available on the internet.

Even though we did not put any identifying information in the summary document it is possible that someone who knows you and knows that you contribute to the Autistica/Turing Citizen Science project might be able to guess that it was you who gave this feedback. If you choose to remove some of your comments from the public version of the document to protect your personal privacy we will still use them to guide the platform development. Your comfort and confidence in our processes are more important than making the information available for others to read.

If there are changes you would like us to make we will send you an updated version that includes those changes for you to confirm that we have made them to your satisfaction.

After you have confirmed that you are happy with the summary we will add the summary to the community recommendations folder of our GitHub repository ([https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/tree/master/community-recommendations](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/tree/master/community-recommendations)). We will also create a summary of the feedback from all the user tests of this round that we will use to create tasks for the development team. This summary will also be made available online and we will email you a copy for your records.

We would appreciate it if you could send us your comments or approval **before the end of the day on [ADD DATE]**. We can also go through the document with you in an online meeting, if you would prefer. If you need more time to review, please let me know and we can adapt the deadline to your schedule.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments about the process. We will run more user testing sessions in the future and your feedback makes it easier for other members of the autistic community to co-create our project.

Best wishes, and thank you again,

[NAME]
