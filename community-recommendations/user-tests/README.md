## Running your own 1:1 online user testing sessions

### Why should I run user testing sessions?
Feedback from the community is really valuable in order to build a platform that is accessible and easy to use for a wide range of people. 

### What is a 1:1 online user testing session? 
In our case, a 1:1. online user testing session is an online-conference with the conferencing tool zoom (or another tool of your choice), during which you show the prototype of the platform (for example by sharing a link to an online prototype, e.g. with the tool Axure), and ask some questions about it. It can also include little tasks related to the feature you would likte to get feedback on. A session should not take too long to avoid effects of fatigue (around 40 min as an orientation) and should be well prepared. For more information, see [how-to-prepare-a-1-to-1-online-user-testing-session.md](how-to-prepare-a-1-to-1-online-user-testing-session.md).

### When should I run user testing sessions?
You can run testing sessions any time that you would like to get feedback on features of the prototype. However, since the organisation, execution and analysis of user testing sessions takes quite some time for you and the participants, it is recommended to wait until there are enough questions to fill a session of around 40 min. As an orientation, try doing one run of user tests for every or every second sprint.
