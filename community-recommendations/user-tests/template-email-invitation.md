Hi [NAME]!  

Here's more information about the user testing next week. **Please let us know if there's a good 40 minute slot that would suit you between [INSERT DATES]** and we'll send you an invite!  

We're delighted you'd like to help us design the Autistica Citizen Science Platform through your feedback! Feedback from the community is really valuable for us in order to build a platform that is accessible and easy to use for a wide range of people. We would like to gather feedback from you in a so-called online _user testing session_. In our case, that means that we will invite you to an online-conference with the conferencing tool zoom, show you the prototype of the platform, and ask you some questions about it. The session will take about 40 min. The schedule is as follows:

*[PLEASE APAPT THE  FOLLOWING CURSIVE PHRASES ACCORDING TO YOUR NEEDS:]*

### Introduction and Formalities Session (if requested)
-   *Explaining what the session will involve*
-   *Working through the documents together*
    
### User Testing Session (~ 40 min)
-   *Welcome, recap of the agenda (5 min)*
-   *Introductory questions (5 min)*
-   *Working with the prototype (20 min)*
	-   *Topic of this session: Main functions (landing page, input of experiences, experience view) and accessibility settings*
-   *Concluding questions (5 min)*
-   *Description of next steps (5 min)*
    
Before we can start the user testing session, we need to provide you with some information to make sure you know about the project, how user testing works, and are happy for us to use the feedback from those sessions to build the platform.  
  
This is a list of those documents (they are all attachments to this email)  

-   the consent form (**please sign this and return it**)  
-   the participant information sheet
-   the code of conduct
-   the guidelines for building a safe community
-   the payment form (**please sign this and return it**)  
    
If you like, we can help you go through and fill out the documents (e.g. we can do this together in a call or just ask us your questions via email).  
  
Please let us know if and when you have time to participate in a testing session and if you would like to read and fill out the documents on your own or together with us.  
  
Best regards,  
[NAME]
