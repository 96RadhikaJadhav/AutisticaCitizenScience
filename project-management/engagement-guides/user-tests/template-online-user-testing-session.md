		-   Ask if it is ok if somebody joins the session as a listener (if applicable)
		-   Ask them to choose a date and time for the user testing session
		-   Make sure the participants read, fill and sign the documents (on their own or with your assistance)
		-   Make sure the participants know how to use the video conferencing software (possibly do a test run with them)
		-   Schedule the meeting

# During the session

### Introduction & Formalities (Maybe organise a separate session with the participant to help them fill in the documents etc.)
-   Welcome
-   Ask if the participant has **read, filled in and signed** all the documents and if he has any questions or comments.
-   Possibly introduce the Autistica Citizen Science project, ask the participant about prior involvement and prior knowledge about the project. Show the project website if you like [https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/AutisticaCitizenScience/](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/AutisticaCitizenScience/)
-   [https://www.autistica.org.uk/our-research/our-research/your-research-priorities](https://www.autistica.org.uk/our-research/our-research/your-research-priorities)
-   Explain that we want to develop the platform together with people from the autistic community, which is why we are doing feedback sessions like this one
-   **Explain what the session will involve:**
	-  [INSERT EXPLANATION HERE]
-   Remind the participant that this user testing session is **not about measuring performance**. It is about improving the platform and making it easy to use by a wide range of people. Any feedback, positive or negative, is really valuable for us.
-   Make clear that they can **ask any question or raise any concern at any time**
-   Remind the user tester that they can **end the session at any time without having to give a reason**. Explain that they do **not need to answer any question** which they do not want to answer.
-   Verify if it is ok to **record the session**. Inform the participants that the audio file will not be uploaded anywhere, just a **summary with anonymised quotes** that the participant can verify before publication.
-   Explain that if they have **complaint** with the interviewer they can contact people from Autistica or the Whitaker Lab (as indicated on the consent form)
-   Explain that they have the option of emailing one of the facilitators if they have any additional points that they would like to share after the session ends.
-   Possibly screen sharing practice
-   Ask the user tester what you can do to make them **more comfortable** in the session.
    

### Testing Session

#### Introductory Questions
[*You can adapt these questions as you like*]

-   What is your connection to autism?
    
-   Do you regularly use computers or mobile devices (smartphone, tablet)? What do you use them for? (e.g. social media, online shopping, entertainment…)
    
-   Are there any accessibility tools or features that you use to access these sites?
    
-   Which devices would you probably use to input experiences with the Autistica Citizen Science Platform? (mobile, tablet, desktop)
    
[
*Now add a section for every topic that interests you. Send the user a link to the current prototype and ask them to share their screen. Give them a task, ask them to imagine a scenario, observe their behaviour and ask them to 'think aloud' as they inspect the prototype. Ask any questions that interest you. Here is an example of a previous user test:*

#### Example: Landing Page

-   Send the following link to the participant, ask them to open it and share their screen. Alternatively, if they don’t want to/there are technical problems etc., you can open it and share your screen. Remind them that this is a prototype/wireframe and not a fully functioning website, so not every button will work as expected and some things might still be WIP

	-   This link leads to:
	-   [https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=0-home-light-non-newsletter-lang-drop__1___1_&view=b](https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=0-home-light-non-newsletter-lang-drop__1___1_&view=b)
    
-   Explain the following scenario:
	-   *Think about a challenging experience that you/your child had in the past that was related to sensory input as you were going about your daily life. For example, think about noise, light, crowded places, transport, or whatever comes to your mind. You can also make something up. Imagine you would like to share this experience online via the Autistica Citizen Science platform.*
	-   *Please open the link and have a look at the landing page. Orient yourself on the page and read through the components in an order of your choice. Please “think aloud”, just tell us what comes to your mind, e.g. what you think the parts of the page mean and if everything is understandable. You can also comment structure and design, or anything else that comes to your mind. You will receive further instructions after that.
-   Is there anything missing or confusing?*
-   *Please activate the screen reader toggle* [https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=0-home-light-screen-reader-toggle-final](https://c6q95y.axshare.com/#g=1&p=0-home-light-screen-reader-toggle-final) . Is it easy to use and understand? Do you find this function useful?
-   Ask the participant to click on “login”.
]
        
        

#### Concluding Questions
[*You can adapt these questions as you like*]
-   After seeing the wireframes, …
    

	-   ...how easy and intuitive do you find the platform? (1-5) → 1 hard, 5 easy
    
	-   ...how likely is it that you would use this platform once it is online? (1 not at all, 5 very likely)
    

	-   If it is unlikely, please explain why. Would you change your mind if something was different?
    

-   What feedback would you give on this user testing session itself? Is there anything you would like us to change in the future?
    
-   Is there anything more you would like to add?
    

  

### Thank you & Next Steps

-   Tell the participant that...
    

	-   you will pay the participants directly into their bank account using the information they provided
	    
	-   you will summarise the insights from the session in an anonymised form
	    
	-   you will send them the summary and allow them two weeks to request any changes
	    
	-   after that period, the summary will be made publicly available on the GitHub repository
	    
	-   the audio file will be deleted
	    
	-   they can contact Georgia Aitkenhead (gaitkenhead@turing.ac.uk), Dr. Kirstie Whitaker ([kwhitaker@turing.ac.uk](mailto:kwhitaker@turing.ac.uk)), Bethan Davies ([bethan.davies@autistica.org.uk](mailto:bethan.davies@autistica.org.uk)) or Dr James Cusack ([james.cusack@autistica.org](mailto:james.cusack@autistica.org)) at any time for any questions or complaints
	    
	-   Can we contact you again to ask you to participate in feedback sessions?
    

# After the session

### Formalities

-   File the consent form and invoice forms securely in Autistica’s London offices
    
-   Pay participants (directly into their bank account using the information they provided on the payment form)
    

### Insights

-   Summarise insights from the session (ensuring that they do not contain any personally identifying information)
    
-   Send the summarised insights to the user tester and the core research team → Allow the user tester two weeks to request comments to be redacted or rephrased
    
-   Redact or rephrase the summary document according to the participants request and in line with the code of conduct (A2)
    
-   After four weeks make the summary document public at the project’s dedicated GitHub repository ([https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/blob/master/project-management/A9_StudyProtocol.pdf)) → the summary document will remain publicly available, and licensed for reuse by anyone, so long as they credit the Autistica/Turing citizen science community
