## Meetings Descriptions

*Backlog refinement* is carried out before each sprint to reprioritise the backlog of user stories (issues) ahead of the next sprint planning meeting.
*Sprint Planning* is carried out at the start of each sprint and is when the user stories (issues) that are planned to be completed in that sprint are chosen.
