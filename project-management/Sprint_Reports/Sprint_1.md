# Sprint 1 Report.
### sprint ending 31/03/2020

Due to the structure of the project at the beginning of this sprint Chris Legg chose to create a wireframe to give a starting point to the development. The user stories for this sprint were lifted from business goals and objectives built into the documentation. At the time the community feedback user stories were in development and not accessible to the team so the links to the issue numbers couldn't be added without facing repitition later in the project. This has caused a delay in the publishing of this sprint report.
