# Focus group review guidelines

Thank you for helping us design and build a citizen science platform to learn from autistic people’s lived experience of navigating sensory environments.

This document contains guidelines for reading the summary of the focus group you participated in in September or October 2019.
The summary has been sent to you in a separate document by email.

We estimate that reading the summaries will take up to two hours of your time.
We will pay all insight group member £30 to compensate them for this work.

You will be paid whether or not you ask us to make any changes.

If the process is confusing, or if you have any questions, please contact Georgia at [gaitkenhead@turing.ac.uk](mailto:gaitkenhead@turing.ac.uk).
She can talk you through the summaries and take your feedback via phone call or Skype if you would prefer. 

## What is the summary?

We want to share the insights from our conversations to help others understand how they can best support the needs of autistic people with sensory processing differences.

The summary document is a collection of anonymised quotes from focus group participants.

## How was the summary written?

### 1. Attend focus group <img src="../../images/noun-project-icons/noun_Conversation_2041500.png" width="150" align="right"/>

On `date` you came to a focus group at Fujitsu to talk about a project to design a platform to use for autism research.

The focus group was recorded.

### 2. Transcribe discussion <img src="../../images/noun-project-icons/noun_transcript_532343.png" width="150" align="right"/>

The focus group was written down word-for-word. No personally identifying information was included in this process.

Personally identifying information includes:

* Names of individuals
* Precise ages
* Schools, workplaces, universities, and addresses

The recordings were then deleted.

### 3. Collect anonymised quotes <img src="../../images/noun-project-icons/noun_Document_188540.png" width="150" align="right"/>

Quotations were taken from the document, shortened, and organised into groups based on common themes.

These insights are contained in the summary document  you have been sent.

## What happens next?

### 4. Review the summary document <img src="../../images/noun-project-icons/noun_Eye_2040041.png" width="150" align="right"/>

You have a chance to review the summary document and make changes.

More information about how to review the document is available below.

### 5. Publish insights online <img src="../../images/noun-project-icons/noun_Eye_2040041.png" width="150" align="right"/>

The summary documents are published online at: [https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience).

The quotes from the focus groups can be used by anyone and for any purpose.
Anyone using the information must credit the Autistica/Citizen Science community.

Potential users include:

* Future contributors to this project who want to add to the insights from the focus groups.
* Autism researchers and advocates who want to make sure they are serving the needs of autistic people.
* Parents, friends and colleagues who want to better understand how to support an autistic person they know.

### 6. Write down platform requirements <img src="../../images/noun-project-icons/noun_todolist_1128326.png" width="150" align="right"/>

Your suggestions are turned into a to-do list for the project team of researchers, developers, and designers, and for the wider community.

They will be used to help build the citizen science platform. 

We can't do everything, but we will try our best to follow your suggestions.
