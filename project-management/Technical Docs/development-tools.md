# Web technologies
In this project, we envisage the use of HTML and CSS as a bare minimum. There is also potentially some scope for client side JavaScript in order to create more dynamic content.

## Frameworks
Whilst it is not necessary to use a web framework in order to create a web application, it can be used in order to cut the time required to get going.

For example, [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) and [bulma](https://bulma.io) are front-end web frameworks.

### Bootstrap
Bootstrap prides itself as being the "most popular open source front-end framework in the world" and so that would suggest it is popular with developers. It is relatively simple to use and contains a large selection of [pre-built components](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/alerts/).

It uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript (jQuery).

As far as long term support goes, bootstrap was originally a Twitter offering, which quickly became entirely open-source in 2011. 8 Years later it is still going strong and development on their [github repository](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) is very active.

### Bulma
Bulma is much more recent than Bootstrap, but it is certainly up and coming. The provided framework is 100% CSS, and *requires* no JavaScript. This typically means it is much more lightweight, however the real world performance differences would be negligible.

Part of is modernity is that it is built from the ground up on the relativity new "[Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox)" which is a CSS display pattern that responded to the proportions of the screen in order to create responsive designs with ease. (As of Bootstrap v4 it uses Flexbox too)

### Conclusion

Bulma is a great CSS framework and perfect for getting started. It provides just enough and is extremely lightweight. However, Bootstrap has an enormous amount of community support, and so for an open-source project it makes sense to go with it.

## Why Django?
### What is Django?
Django is a framework written in python which allows for server-side rendering of web applications. It was designed to be utilised for rapid development, taking security and scalability into mind. [(source)](https://www.djangoproject.com)

## Pros to using Django in context
* There is already a library for [OpenHumans/django-open-humans](https://github.com/OpenHumans/django-open-humans)
* Python is widely known as a good starter language, for example it is taught in lots of schools. This could mean an increase in contributions.
* Django is relatively simple once set up, and so would be easy for someone to contribute even at a later date.
