## Pros to using Django in context
* There is already a library for [OpenHumans/django-open-humans](https://github.com/OpenHumans/django-open-humans)
* Python is widely known as a good starter language, for example it is taught in lots of schools. This could mean an increase in contributions.
* Django is relatively simple once set up, and so would be easy for someone to contribute even at a later date.
