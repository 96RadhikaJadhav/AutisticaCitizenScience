### Backlog Prioritisation / Meeting minutes:

* We werent able to do Backlog Priorisation today due to the issues not being uploaded onto Github.
* We discussed the expectations for Sprint 3 and what the approach will be to be able to perform a Backlog Refinement next week. 
* Sprint 3 will be a technical Sprint; we have Development resources available to start. 
* Agreed that when an issue is recorded on github it will be cross referenced (link back) back to the google spreadsheet. 

### Preparation tasks for Sprint 3 Backlog refinement:

1. Idenfying usable user stories from the Wireframe Design
2. Transposing all user stories from the Google Doc onto GitHub

### GA Actions: 

* There is a dependency on the relevant issues being uploaded onto Github ahead of the next Backlog refinement meeting 21st April 2020
* There is a meeting planned on 16th April 2020 to discuss which which issues are uploaded from the Google Doc spreadsheet. 
* Create a readme which collates all of the documentation on how the user stories are created https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/issues/160
