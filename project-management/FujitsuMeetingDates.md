# Fujitsu/Turing Sprint Meetings
## Meetings Descriptions
Each sprint is 15 days (approx. 3 work weeks long) therefore each of these meetings occurs every 3 weeks. 
The whole Alan Turing and Fujitsu team are invited to these meetings and a member of the community will be included in retrospective meetings.
*Backlog refinement* is carried out before each sprint to reprioritise the backlog of user stories (issues) ahead of the next sprint planning meeting.
*Sprint Planning* is carried out at the start of each sprint and is when the user stories (issues) that are planned to be completed in that sprint are chosen.
*Sprint retrospective* is carried out at the end of each sprint to consider how the sprint went and any changes that need to be made to the process before the next sprint.
During this meeting a demo of the achievements (which will have been released prior to the meeting) of the previous sprint will be shown. 

More details about the Agile process can be found in the Agile - Open source workflow document also in the project management folder.
