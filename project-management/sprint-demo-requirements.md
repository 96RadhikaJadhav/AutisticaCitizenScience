# Public demonstration of sprint progress

This document describes the video and updates to the sprint report text file that are shared at the end of each Agile sprint by the Fujitsu team.

 ## Background, problem statement, proposed solution

Described in more detail in [agile-opensource-workflow.md](agile-opensource-workflow.md), there is a tension between *continual* and *continuous* project development.

Specifically, defining work at the beginning of a (usually 2 week) sprint makes it difficult for members of the autistic community to share their feedback with the Fujitsu project team.
A traditional Agile workflow would require them to be present for the end of sprint demonstration.
People who are not paid to be part of the project will struggle to be available at those specific times.
By only presenting to a small group of community members we will not deliver on our values of a [*participatory*](project-values.md#participatory-science) and [*inclusive*](project-values.md#diversity-and-inclusion) development project.

Our proposed solution is to publicly release a video visually presenting the work that has been done during the sprint and a text sprint report file detailing the issues and pull requests that were addressed during the sprint.

Members of the project community include autistic people, their families, members of the Open Humans community, autism researchers, Turing Institute researchers and open source contributors more broadly.
These community members can watch the video and read the sprint report at any time and share their feedback via GitHub or the "always open" Google form.

## Sprint report

The [sprint report text file](/SPRINTREPORT.md) is similar to a [standard changelog file](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).
The goal of the sprint report is to capture project progress.

It is distinct from the changelog which is only updated on a new release of the project.

The sprint report should contain a list of issues that have been [closed](#closed-issues), [progressed](#progressed-issues) or [opened](#opened-issues) during the sprint.
It should also include a bullet point list of [challenges](#challenges) that the team faced, and any issues where [community feedback](#community-feedback-requests) is particularly requested.

### Closed issues

This section of the sprint report contains links to issues that were closed during the sprint.
Associated merged pull requests should also be linked (if applicable).

If necessary, change the issue title to make the sprint report easier to read.

Template section format:

> * [`#i`](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/issues/`i`): `issue title`
>   * Assocated pull requests: [`#a`](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/pull/`a`), [`#b`](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/issues/`b`)
>   * *Additional notes if necessary.*

### Progressed issues

This section of the sprint report contains links to issues that were addressed during the sprint but which are not yet closed.
Associated "work in progress" (`[WIP]`) or "ready for review" (`[MRG]`) pull requests should also be linked (if applicable).

If necessary, change the issue title to make the sprint report easier to read.

Template section format:

> * [`#k`](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/issues/`k`): `issue title`
>   * Assocated pull requests: [`#e`](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/pull/`e`), [`#f`](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/issues/`f`)
>   * *Additional notes if necessary.*

### Opened issues

This section of the sprint report contains links to issues that were opened but not addressed during the sprint.

If necessary, change the issue title to make the sprint report easier to read.

Template section format:

> * [`#m`](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/issues/`m`): `issue title`
>   * *Additional notes if necessary.*

### Challenges

This section of the sprint report captures challenges that the Fujitsu team faced during the sprint.
The challenges should include links to the relavent issues and pull requests where applicable.

> * `challenge description`
>   * Related to issues: [`#o`](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/issues/`o`), [`#p`](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/issues/`p`)
>   * *Additional notes if necessary.*

### Community Feedback Requests

This section of the sprint report captures issues and pull requests where community feedback is particularly requested.

This section should always link to an issue asking for feedback on the sprint demo itself.
That issue must contain a link to the video and to the appropriate section in the Fujistu [sprint report](/SPRINTREPORT.md).

This section may also contain links to working prototypes of the website that community members can interact with and provide their thoughts on.
Make sure that these links have associated issues to capture the feedback (which can be the same as the sprint report issue, or a separate one as appropriate).

> * [`#M`](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/issues/`M`): issue to collect feedback on sprint `N`
>   * Link to video: [`link-to-youtube`](`link-to-youtube`)
>   * Link to sprint report: [SPRINTREPORT.md#`N`](SPRINTREPORT.md#sprint-`N`)
>   * Link to interactive wireframe/prototype: [`link-to-wireframe`](`link-to-wireframe`)
