# Agile and Open Source Development Process

This document describes a workflow that combines participatory, open source and Agile ways of working.

## Background, problem statement, proposed solution

*There needs to be something here that provides a little background about why we need a whole new way of working.*
*Something along the lines of the difference between continual and continuous, and the difference between people who are paid to work on the project vs people who are volunteering their time - both members of the autistic community and volunteer developers.*

This is a project funded by and supported by the Autistic community and therefore every stage of the project requires complete transparency and community feedback. A new way of working needs to be developed to incorporate Alan Turing and Fujitsu to work effectively together. Fujitsu work in an Agile way to develop the platform efficiently.

The Agile work process involves working in 2 week sprints with each sprint producing a minimum viable product and a demo of that product. This continual process allows regular feedback from the autistic community. This method accommodates the need for Fujitsu to work efficiently since they are being paid whilst allowing the volunteering autistic community to feedback in their own time.

## Initial scoping

### 1. Focus groups

The initial platform requirements are supported by extensive discussions between autistic people and their supporters, researchers, developers, and funders, as well as from online feedback and contributions from the online community.

*Link here to processes for running and managing data from the focus groups*

### 2. Extracting tasks from focus group insights

The insights from the focus groups are collected together and written into a comprehensive list of tasks and user stories by researchers and developers, which are the project’s backlog.

The tasks and user stories are published as individual GitHub issues, and grouped under appropriate milestones on the project’s open repository. 

### 3. Prioritisation

The tasks and user stories are prioritised (with the input of members of the autistic community) in an initial backlog refinement session, and Fujitsu assign themselves a portion, which is their backlog.

The issues that correspond to the backlog are transferred to the Fujitsu team's fork of the GitHub repository.

### 4. Completion of tasks

Completed tasks are submitted as pull requests to the main repository.

The remaining user stories remain open as issues on GitHub for anyone to develop or contribute to on an ad hoc continual basis.

*:point_up: This feels like it needs to be a step on its own...* *does this fix do the job?*

## Continuous development

### 5. Sprint meetings every 2 weeks

The team (made up of Fujitsu developers and Alan Turing members) have fortnightly agile sprint cycles, beginning with a retrospective of the previous sprint cycle and a sprint planning session in which some of the issues in the Fujitsu team's backlog are pulled into the sprint backlog - where the sprint backlog is the issues that will be covered in that sprint.

*clarify the difference between sprint backlog and team backlog - done?*

### 5. Publish demo

At the end of every 2 week sprint, the Fujitsu team will openly publish a video demonstration of the work they have achieved during the sprint.

*Where? How long? As a PR to the repo? And then maybe open an accompanying issue to collect comments?*

*Fujitsu marketing could get involved with this... needs to be discussed with the entire team*

The community are asked to review this video and share their thoughts and feedback.

### 6. Integrating asynchronous comments

The Fujitsu team work on the next iteration of the demo and gather feedback from the previous sprint's demo.

The two workflows are asynchronous, since the feedback collected on the demo will be one sprint behind what the Fujitsu team are beginning to work on.
