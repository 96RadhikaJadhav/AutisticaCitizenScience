# Agile and Open Source Development Process

This document describes a workflow that combines participatory, open source and Agile ways of working.

## Background, problem statement, proposed solution

This is a project funded and supported by the autistic community and therefore every stage of the project requires complete transparency and community feedback.

There is a tension between the [*continual*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/continual) - regularly repeated - development cycles of an Agile workflow, and the [*continuous*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/continuous) - without stopping - development process in an open source community of volunteers.

A *continual* Agile sprint only provides one point in time to plan what work will be done.
The process is rigorously time-locked process.
Development is usually undertaken by a team who know how much time they can commit to the project.
(For example because they are being paid to complete it.)
A [sprint backlog](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/scrum-tools/sprint-backlog) is defined in the planning meeting at the start of the sprint and there is a general rule that no additional tasks are added outside of that meeting.

A *continuous* open source workflow can be undertaken at any time.
Open source work is often (although not always) done by volunteers who are not paid to develop the project and who are contributing in their spare time.
It is difficult to determine when the work will be completed.

This document describes a balance between the two ways of working that allow the Fujitsu team to maintain their Agile workflow and for members of the broader project community to contribute when they are able.

All parties are committed to working in an Agile (and agile) way to develop the platform efficiently.

## Initial scoping

### 1. Focus groups

The initial platform requirements are supported by extensive discussions between autistic people and their supporters, researchers, developers, and funders, as well as from online feedback and contributions from the online community.

### 2. Extracting tasks from focus group insights

The insights from the focus groups are collected together and written into a comprehensive list of tasks and user stories by researchers and developers, which are the projectâ€™s backlog.

The tasks and user stories are published as individual GitHub issues, and grouped under appropriate milestones on the project's open repository.

### 3. Prioritisation

The tasks and user stories are prioritised (with the input of members of the autistic community) in an initial backlog refinement session, and Fujitsu assign themselves a portion, which is their backlog.

The issues that correspond to the backlog are transferred to the Fujitsu team's fork of the GitHub repository.

### 4. Completion of tasks

Completed tasks are submitted as pull requests to the main repository.

The remaining user stories remain open as issues on GitHub for anyone to develop or contribute to on an ad hoc continuous basis.

## Continuous development

### 5. Publish sprint report and video demonstration

At the end of every 2 week sprint, the Fujitsu team will publicly release a [sprint report](#sprint-report) text file detailing the issues and pull requests that were addressed during the sprint and a [video](#video) of the work they have achieved during the sprint.

Details of this release can be found in the [sprint-demo-requirements.md](project-management/sprint-demo-requirements.md) file.
The sprint report will be added to the [SPRINTREPORT.md](SPRINTREPORT.md) file in the main GitHub repository ([https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience)).

The community are asked to review this video and share their thoughts and feedback.

*Fujitsu marketing could get involved with this... needs to be discussed with the entire team*

### 6. Sprint meetings every 2 weeks

The Fujitsu team have fortnightly agile sprint cycles, beginning with a retrospective of the previous sprint cycle and a sprint planning session.
During the sprint planning session some of the issues in the Fujitsu team's backlog are pulled into the sprint backlog.
The sprint backlog is a collection of issues that will be covered during that sprint.

### 7. Integrating asynchronous comments

The Fujitsu team work on the next iteration of the demo and gather feedback from the previous sprint's demo.

The two workflows are asynchronous, since the feedback collected on the demo will be one sprint behind what the Fujitsu team are beginning to work on.
