## Swim lane descriptions

### 1.0 Backlog
A list of issues created predominantly by the Product Owner (Turing Institute) which are then team review in the backlog refinement session.
The list of issues stay in the backlog swim lane until the day 1 of sprint planning where thet are then moved to the ‘To-Do’ swim lane

### 2.0 To-Do (current sprint)
Issues prioritised by the Product Owner during backlog refinement sessions and have been agreed to bring into a sprint for work to commence on them will be in this swim lane.
When any given person starts to work on the issue, they must move it to in-development/progress state.

### 3.0	In development/progress
Issues moved from the To-Do state 
Issues in progress during the sprint cycle days 1 to 15

### 4.0	Blocked
A blocker might be an issue or bug which you have come across during development or testing and which is not allowing you to develop or test further
Issues that are marked as blocked may be due to missing information, awaiting information or clarification on the issue.

### 5.0	In pull requests (awaiting review)
Once branches are considered done (code reviewed) and ready for testing.  A pull request is a way to ask another developer to merge one of your branches into the master branch and that it is ready for testing.

### 6.0	Ready for testing
Once issues are considered development complete and code review, approved issues are moved into the Ready for testing state unless it is an issue that does not require testing.
In this instance, you would move the ticket to Done state.

### 7.0	In testing
When you start testing an issue move it into this swim lane.
If you have a concerns whilst testing the issue then add a comment and set it back to the To-Do state.

### 8.0	Ready for review 
When testing is complete and no concerns raised issues will sit under the Ready for review state 
This swim lane is to allow the Product Owner (Alan Turning) to approve the issue and set it to Done.

No concerns means where development tasks have met the success/acceptance criteria as specified in the issue rather than any new customer experience.

### 9.0	Done
A swim lane for all issues that have gone through the process of all/or some of above.
All issues sitting in Done must be approved by the Product Owner prior to closing a sprint.
