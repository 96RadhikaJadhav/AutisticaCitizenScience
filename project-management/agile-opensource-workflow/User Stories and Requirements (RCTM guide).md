## Introduction and Background

A Requirements Catalogue and Traceability Matrix (RCTM) document serves as a repository to record all requirements in a project. As this project is a community lead project, requirements recorded in the RCTM are produced from community comments and statements. Because this project is following an Agile style of project management, requirements in the RCTM will folow a  in the format of Agile User Story statements. 

For those unfamiliar with Agile concepts, an Agile User Story is a simple statement that records a particular user need and justification for the need. User Stories follow the format of:

As a … I would like … So that ... 

As you will have noticed, the Agile User story is quite short. This is very deliberate as User Stories are meant to record specific demands  

For those wishing 

In addition to the User Story statement, the RCTM also records Acceptance Criteria for each User Story. The recording of acceptance criteria is vitally important as it is this information that enables a user story to become suitable for development and subsequently for functional and user acceptance testing.  Acceptance criteria provide the necessary boundaries and characteristics that a developed solution must meet to ensure that higher level user needs are appropriately addressed by the developed solution.

## Operational Importance and purpose of the RCTM in the project workflow

There are several key important factors that that the RCTM serves within the project operation:

* Firstly: Because the RCTM serves as a repository of project requirements, it is a critical tool in the project managers toolbox that a project manager and product owner can refer to therefore ensuring the deliverables under development fall within scope of the customer/community expectations.

* Secondly: The RCTM serves as a tool to process unstructured community feedback into correctly formed project goals, business requirements and functional requirements. This is a crucial step to ensure that the project’s goals, business requirements and functional requirements can be clearly identified from an original set of  unstructured customer/community feedback. Identifying the functional requirements from the projects goals and business requirements is of particular importance because, whereas project goals and business requirements are suitable for conveying the justification of the project and the project individual deliverables, it is the functional requirements that are used by those who create the project deliverables to understand how each deliverable needs to be constructed in order to satisfactorily meet the customer/community requirement.

* Thirdly: Because the RCTM serves as a tool that helps to ensure that what is recorded as a project business and functional requirement is correctly identified and written, the RCTM is an important tool to ensure that confusion later in the workflow pipeline is eliminated. This will be of particular importance in the development and testing stages of the project. Having a concise set of project deliverable requirements is important in ensuring the smooth operation of the project from a delivery and testing perspective. 


FigX shows where in the project workflow the RCTM sits as a critical tool for managing the creation of project deliverable requirements from unstructured community feedback. The RCTM serves the purpose of providing the traceability of Github Issues back to community comments such that each Github issue can be proven to be justified.



## Understanding the User Stories and Requirements (RCTM)



#### Identifying User Stories



The RCTM is split into various groups or regions of related . In Agile terminology we call a set of related User Stories an Epic and therefore each group or region within the RCTM is also technically reffered to as an Epic.  

Platform requirements in the RCTM spreadsheet fall into Epic category groupings. Epics are used to organise User Stories into logical groupings that share a common objective. 

Under each Epic region within the RCTM relevant User Stories are listed. Community statements from meetings such as 

that backup User Stories  all fall under the same grouping. This is shown in figureX where the dark green grouping talks about Z and the light green grouping talks about Y.

#### How community comments are processed into requirements in the RCTM

There are distinct phases of data processing activity that must be undertaken to effectively process unstructured feedback into fully formed User Stories in the RCTM.

Stage 1: Before information containing community feedback is imported into the RCTM, it must first be processed to ensure that it is in suitable format for processing. The RCTM requires information to be recorded in a textual format whereby the text is broken down into individual statements as opposed to block paragraphs that cover several opinions. An example of where this processing stage is required can be found where audio recordings of community insight group meetings are translated into transcript documents and where subsequently these transcripts documents are then used to feed into the RCTM process. 

Stage 2: The output of Stage 1 can be used to populate the receiving area of the RCTM. This receiving area is used as a temporary location to store new community feedback that is yet to undergo any form of RCTM processing. When populating the receiving area with new community feedback statement, the following columns should be populated:

* Source: The name of the document source where the statement is originating from and the specific location within the document that the statement has come from such as a page number. 

* Speaker: The type of person from the community that raised the statement.

* I would like: The specific demand in the statement from the community member.

* So that: What the demand means for the community member if it were to be developed? What problem does the demanded feature as specified in the "I would like" column solve? 

* Proposed success criteria: Any technical specifics about the "I would like" column demand that describes how the demanded feature should be implemented in development.

Stage 3: Each recorded statement in the RCTM as per the output of Stage 2 will be individually assessed by the project Product Owner and or Solution Owner to determine whether the statement should be recorded as a project goal, business requirement or functional requirement. Furthermore the assessment of the statement will determine which Epic the statement should fall within and also if there is a related group of statements within the Epic that already talk about the same demand.


As assessed by the project’s business anaIyst, if written sufficiently that the statement covers the necessary detail    




#### User story progress

User Story progress is shown by the progress indicator. The indicator uses several different characters to show the current state of progress.

| Character  | Meaning |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| <div style="padding:5px">[BLANK]</div> | Content Cell The writing of the user story is not yet finished and is therefore not yet included on Github |
|   <div style="background-color:rgb(142, 124, 195); padding:5px">S</div> | The user story is shown to be in scope for development |
| <div style="background-color:rgb(60, 120, 216); padding:5px">D</div> | The user story is in development. It is being progressed by the development team in the current sprint  |
| <div style="background-color:rgb(102, 102, 102); padding:5px">C</div> | The development of the User Story is complete. The User Story has been fully tested and delivered.  |

User Stories that are included on the project backlog in Github will show the Github issue number after the progress indicator. For example an issue that is in development and with Github Issue number #6 will be shown as:

```
D:#6
```

#### Readiness for Backlog Inclusion

User Stories that are written correctly and are therefore ready for inclusion on the product backlog are highlighted in blue in Column A of the RCTM. This is shown in Fig X. User Stories that are not fully written cannot be ready for product backlog inclusion as they do not contain all the necessary detail needed for the development and testing phases. A typical reason for a user story to be kept unassigned from the ready state would be that not all success criteria have been identified and therefore assumptions would have to be made in order to complete development.
