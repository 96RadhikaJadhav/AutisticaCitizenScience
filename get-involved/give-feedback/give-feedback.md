## Give feedback on designs

Give us feedback on our designs! Every 15 days a new video is published showing the work we've done. Watch the videos and tell us what you think:

    Sprint 3 video

If you do have coding skills or are looking to learn some, you can help by addressing issues, reviewing pull requests, and answering questions on the project's GitHub repository.
