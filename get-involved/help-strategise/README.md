## Help with strategy 

We seek community input for how we run the project and how we document it.

If there's something you'd like us to do or groups you feel we should engage with please let us know.

Information about project management protocols can be found in the [project management](/project-management) directory.

You may find the following information useful: 

* [Project values](project-management/project-values.md)
* [Planned outputs](project-management/planned-outputs.md)
* [Data management](project-management/data-management.md)
* [Building a safe and valued community](project-management/building-a-safe-community.md)
